   2EL5070 - Image processing       Instructors: Jean-Luc Collette  Department: CAMPUS DE METZ  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE METZ  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Fundamental Sciences  Advanced level : Yes      Description  Image  processing  meets  many  areas  of  activity,  such  as  medical  imaging,  satellite or robotics for localization in an environment. The preliminary step  to  image  processing  is  its  acquisition.  The  modeling  of  image  sensors  is  therefore  crucial  to  make  the  best  use  of  the  information  that  can  be  extracted. The images can also come from a reconstruction process such as  that implemented in a scanner. The transmission and the compression of the  images  intervene  in  the  quality  of  the  results  of  their  analyzes.  We  must  understand its principles to take them into account in these analyzes. The  different  treatments  that  can  be  considered  are  then  presented.  Many  applications will illustrate this course to have an overview on how to exploit  the information in the image.

Unsupervised classification      Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)    15h of lecture, 6h of tutorials and 14h of labs.  35 students for tutorial/labs groups     Grading    A written report will be requested on Laboratory Work (TP) and an oral  presentation on this activity will also be organized (scheduled during labs).  Any unjustified absence from a TP session will result in a zero mark. The  final mark will be the equal average of the individual mark of the oral  presentation and the mark of the laboratory work report.  The catch up exam will take place in the same way as the initial  examination, with additional work requested in TP and an oral  presentation of this work.

Applications will be tested on computer during tutorial courses.     Learning outcomes covered on the course     • Knowing how to identify imperfections and limitations of operation of an  image acquisition system.  • Knowing how to model and characterize this system in the optical  domain.  • Knowing how to program or use basic processing algorithms (filtering,  transformations) on digital images by mastering their complexity.  • Having an overview of how to use the information in the image.
