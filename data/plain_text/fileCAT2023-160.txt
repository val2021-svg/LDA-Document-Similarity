   2SC6490 - Development of a sensor monitoring system       Instructors: Jean-Francois Lalande  Department: DOMINANTE - SYSTÈMES COMMUNICANTS ET OBJETS CONNECTÉS,  DOMINANTE - INFORMATIQUE ET NUMÉRIQUE  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE RENNES  Workload (HEE): 40  On-site hours (HPE): 27,00          Description    In  partnership  with  other  students  of  the  campus  following  the  thematic  sequences "Smart Building" and "Health" STs, the objective is to develop the  information  system  that  will  enable  the  collection  and  processing  of  data  from  sensors,  and  to  provide  services  for  the  regulation.  The  educational  objective is to perceive the specificities of the development of applications  in  the  cloud  et  to  discover  the  interest  of  design  choices  to  facilitate  the  software evolution, and the benefits of an AGILE organization.     Quarter number  ST5     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)   •  Information System and Programming  •  Algorithm and complexity      Syllabus    From a technical point of view, we will aim to develop by a team a complete  infrastructure  for  collecting,  processing  and  displaying  data  from  sensors.  Data from other project groups in other STs will pushed and hosted on a local  server but will then be pushed onto a cloud-like infrastructure. At this stage,  no  treatment  is  performed.  The  data  is  then  re-extracted  and  can  be  processed to be projected into a final data model suitable for presentation.  This  data  will  be  stored  in  a  database  to  be  implemented  by  the  development team. This data is then presented via a REST API to the part of  the team developing the application frontend.    499        Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)  Students will be divided into a project team organized around a project  leader (which can change every day). At the beginning of the day, each  project team will be given features to be provided at the end of the day. In  addition, every day, minor improvements will have to be made in order to  respond as quickly as possible to the needs expressed by students from  other STs during a meeting bringing together all the ST students concerned.    To support the EI, it is expected:   •  a computer room that can accommodate up to 25 people  •  access to a Cloud Computing infrastructure  •  possible VPNs to connect the different software components      Grading  Oral presentations      Resources    •  computers  •  sensors for testing and from other STs     Learning outcomes covered on the course   •  Understand and model the client requests  •  Implement as a team a solution answering the client requests      Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course    •  C4.1 Analyse customer needs, the constraints of other stakeholders   as well as include societal challenges.   Evaluated by a presentation of the global solution fully integrated with the  development of other ST.   •  C7.1 Persuade at the level of core values; to be clear about   objectives and expected results.   Evaluated by a non technical presentation of the global solution in  coordination with other ST.        500
