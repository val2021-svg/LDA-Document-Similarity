   ST7 - 80 - SOURCE SEPARATION FOR OPTIMAL SIGNAL   PROCESSING     Department : MDS (Mathematics, Data Science)  Language of instruction: Français  Campus : Campus de Metz        Engineering problematic   In order to increase productivity, to reduce ecological impact or to improve  the quality of services, manufacturers and research centers must respond to  the issues of data analysis made up of overlapping signals. Indeed, in many  applications, sensor signals are mixtures of several sources that emit at the  same  time,  and  the  information  carried  by  these  signals  can  only  be  exploited  if  we  manage  to  separate  what  comes  from  each  source.  For  example,  in  oil  exploration,  companies  are  now  carrying  out  acquisition  campaigns in simultaneous source mode (several sources emit at the same  time). It is then necessary to distinguish in the signals of the geophones the  echoes due to the various sources to obtain an image of the subsoil. Or in a  "hi-tech" store, a robot that has started a conversation with a person may  be disturbed by other customers or by ambient noise, while it must continue  its conversation with the same person. Or in electrocardiograms, to separate  the signal of the fetus' heart from that of its mother. Or for sound recording  in a conference or round table with several speakers, rather than giving a  microphone  to  each  speaker,  it  would  be practical  to  separate what each  speaker says from recordings of microphones placed in fixed positions. The  solutions to these problems are based on the same mathematical concepts:   •   The  knowledge  of  a  data  representation  space  adapted  to  the  problem, where data have a sparse representation (in other words the data  can be represented by a vector which has a few non-zero coordinates, in a  space of great dimension);   •   •   the minimization of a criterion that depends on the data; and   a  learning  and  testing  stage  to  verify  that  the  obtained  solution   generalizes and thus avoid overfitting.   Necessary prerequisites   First year courses in probability, statistics, signal processing and algorithms;  good skills in a programming environment (Matlab, Python, ...).   Context and issues modules: These modules include an introductory lecture  on the theme, presentations on environmental and societal issues and on   594            technological and scientific challenges, as well as a presentation of related  projects.   Specific course (60 HEE): Sparse representations of signals   -  Brief  description:  This  course  presents  the  mathematical  tools  of  signal  analysis  and  their  properties  (complements  on  the  Fourier  transform,  subsampling/oversampling, harmonic signal, STFT, multiresolution analysis,  Paley-Littlewood  and  bi-orthogonal  wavelet  decompositions,  perfect  reconstruction  filter  banks)  as  well  as  signal  decomposition  methods  (Matching Pursuit, Basis Pursuit, Independent Component Analysis).   Projet n°1 : Tracking a speaker by a robot   -  Associated partner: ORANGE, Cognitive Computing   -  Campus: Campus de Metz   -  Brief description: Robots are increasingly present in our environment. When  a robot has started a conversation with a speaker, the problem is to keep  the  focus  on  the  interlocutor  while  several  people  are  talking  around  the  robot, or another interlocutor is talking to it. ORANGE wants to solve this  problem by using a monophonic audio signal recorded by the robot, without  adding other modalities.   The issue is therefore to find one or more data representation spaces well  adapted to the problem of speaker tracking; to learn from a small number  of samples (i.e. over a small recording duration) the features of the speaker  to be tracked; to avoid overfitting which may occur if the learned features  depend on the words spoken by the speaker.   Projet  n°2 :  Separation  of  sound  sources  from  recordings  of  several  microphones   -  Associated partner: CentraleSupélec, audio plateform of the « smartroom    -  Campus: Campus de Metz   -  Brief description: There are many concrete situations in which you want to  capture a sound so you can either record it for replay or amplify it live so  that  all  participants  have  a  good  perception.  Dans  certaines  de  ces  situations,  plusieurs  sources  peuvent  intervenir  (par  exemple,  une  conférence ou table ronde dans laquelle plusieurs locuteurs sont présents).   In  order  to  allow  good  intelligibility  in  the  case  of  several  speakers,  a  microphone is usually placed in front of each speaker, or, in the theater, a  radio transmitter microphone is placed directly on the actors. A significant  improvement  could  be  to  use  a  fixed  microphone  array  and  to  have  a   595         -   -   processing  algorithm  to  separate  the  sources,  thus  giving  the  illusion  of  having an individual microphone per speaker or actor.   The  problem  is  therefore,  starting  from  a  fixed  microphone  array  and  assuming a finite number of sources (e.g. speakers), to ensure the separation  of the sources and to provide an output channel per source (speaker), which  channel  would  also  contain  the  position  information  of  this  source.  For  simplicity, we will start by assuming that the speakers are at fixed positions  known  in  advance.  This  is  the  case,  for  example,  for  speakers  at  a  round  table. In this case, the system could be  calibrated beforehand using white  noise  generators,  and  then  could  operate  using  the  fixed  parameters  determined in this way.   Projet n°3 : Non-invasive foetal electrocardiogram extraction   Associated partner: INSERM   Campus: Campus de Metz   Brief description: Non-Invasive foetal electrocardiography (NI-FECG)  -  represents an alternative foetal monitoring technique to traditional Doppler  ultrasound approaches, that is non-invasive and has the potential to provide  additional clinical information. However, despite the significant advances in  the field of adult ECG signal processing over the past decades, the analysis  of NI-FECG remains challenging and largely unexplored. This is mainly due to  the relatively low signal-to-noise ratio of the FECG compared to the maternal  ECG, which overlaps in both time and frequency.   The issue is to find one or several data representation spaces well adapted  to the problem of foetal ECG extraction. It will be a question of applying and  testing one or several methods starting from an article that reviews recent  advances  in  NI-FECG  research  including:  publicly  available  databases,  NIFECG  extraction  techniques  foetal  heart  rate  evaluation  and  morphological  analysis,  NI-FECG  simulators  and  the  methodology  and  statistics for assessing the performance of the extraction algorithms..   for      596
