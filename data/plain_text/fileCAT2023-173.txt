         ST7 - 75 - OPTIMIZATION AND MANAGEMENT OF   COMPLEX SYSTEMS FLOWS       Dominante : GSI (Large Interacting Systems) and VSE (Living-Health, Environment)    Langue d’enseignement : French  Campus où le cours est proposé : Paris-Saclay            Engineering problem   The  growing  complexity  of  products  and  services,  the  globalization  of  operations  and  the  increasing  demands  of  customers  place  the  issue  of  flow  management  at  the  heart  of  the  concerns  of  industrial  and  service  companies.    The competitiveness of these companies is strongly linked to their ability  to  organize  themselves  to  produce  and  distribute  products  and  services  that meet customer expectations while ensuring the sustainability of the  company in its economic, social and environmental dimensions.   This leads these companies to develop innovative solutions    in  the  definition  of  the  services  offered  to  customers  (time,   -  personalization, place of delivery,...)   -  in  the  best  way  to  size  and  use  their  resources  (material  resources,  infrastructure, human resources, information systems, etc.)   One of the major challenges to meet these objectives is to optimize the  management of flows, from suppliers to end customers.   This topic addresses these issues by presenting approaches, qualitative and  quantitative models from Industrial Engineering and Operations Research.   Adviced prerequisites   None   Context and issue modules: These modules will include presentations by  industrial  partners  to  illustrate  the  problems  of  flow  management  in  different sectors.   529         Specific course (60 HEE) : Optimization and management of flows   Brief description : Product flow in a factory, parcel flow in a post office,  patient flow in a hospital, customer flow in a supermarket, student flow in  an educational institution: the problems related to the understanding and  management  of  flows  are  present  in  all  sectors  of  activity.  More  than  a  specific problem, flow management is an approach to industrial problems  that  can  be  adapted  to  many  sectors.  Knowing  how  to  understand  and  control flows is a major challenge for industrial performance. This course  introduces  the  problems  related  to  industrial  flow  management  and  presents a tool to tackle these problems, the discrete event simulation.     Project: Flow management in industrial gas delivery   - Associated partner: Air Liquide   - Location: Paris-Saclay   - Short description : This project will allow, on an industrial case proposed  by a partner, the application of the tools seen in the specific course, and in  particular of the discrete event simulation of industrial flow systems. It will  consist  in  defining  a  conceptual  model,  transposing  it  into  a  computer  model,  validating  this  model,  experimenting  with  it,  and  building  a  recommendation for managers based on the simulation results.      530
