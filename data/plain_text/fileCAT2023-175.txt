   2SC7591 - Flow management in industrial gas delivery       Instructors: Guillaume LAMÉ, Loïc Pineau  Department: DOMINANTE - VIVANT, SANTÉ, ENVIRONNEMENT, DOMINANTE -  GRANDS SYSTÈMES EN INTERACTION  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 80  On-site hours (HPE): 48,00        Description   Students will apply the tools provided in the associated course on an  industrial case study proposed by a partner. In particular, they will be able  to implement discrete event simulation on a long and in-depth case study.   In parallel with the associated ST7 course, students will progressively apply  the techniques taught in the course on a real complex industrial problem.  Course reminders will be provided as needed.

Data from the industrial case study.   533         Resources    Industrial case study, with data and information on the context and the  industrial challenge, supervised by a tutor.    Discrete-event simulation software Simul8, and the extension OptQuest for  simulation-optimisation.    Simul8 only exists for Windows. Students using Mac OS will need to install  a virtual machine, which may slow down the simulation software and  compromise its general usability.     Learning outcomes covered on the course    Implementation of discrete event simulation. Conceptual modelling,  implementation into a computer simulation model, model validation,  experimentation.  This course will address the following competencies:   •  C1 Analysing, designing and realising complex systems with  scientific, technological, human and economic components    o  C1.2 Using and developping relevant models, choosing the   righjt modelling scale and simplifying hypotheses to address  the problem   o  C1.3 Resolving the problem through approximating,   simulating and experimenting   •  C2 Developing specific knowledge of a scientific or industrial   domain et a professional domain    o  C2.1 Exploring a scientific or engineering domain or   discipline   •  C3 Acting, innovating in a scientific and technological environment  o  C3.6 Evaluating the effectiveness, feasibility and robustness   of proposed solutions   •  C7 Being convincing.   o  C7.1 Being clear on objectives and expected results. Being   rigorous on the hypotheses and the method. Structuring  ideas and arguments. Highlighting value creation.   •  C8 Leading a project, a team.   o  C8.1 Working as a team/collaboratively.  o  C8.4 Working in project mode, using project management   techniques as required by the situation.     Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course   Implementation of discrete event simulation on a real case-study.   534
