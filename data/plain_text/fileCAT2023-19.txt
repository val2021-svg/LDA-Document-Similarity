   2EL1130 - Dynamical Multi-Agent Systems. Application   to drones formation control       Instructors: Cristina-Nicoleta Maniu  Department: DÉPARTEMENT AUTOMATIQUE  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Engineering Sciences  Advanced level : Yes      Description   Numerous applications involve formation of several autonomous systems,  capable of cooperation in a specific environment and of reconfiguration for  the mission achievement. In particular, formation flying (Unmanned Aerial  Vehicles - UAVs, satellites, etc.), car traffic control or pedestrians behavior  in a crowd highlight the notion of a dynamic Multi-Agent System (MAS).    In the context of rescue missions (large-scale fire extinguishing missions,  search for avalanche victims or black boxes in a large environment, etc.),  the coordination and the control of a fleet of autonomous vehicles  becomes key elements. These multi-agent missions relay on several MAS  concepts such as tasks assignment, trajectory/path planning, and induce  control problems in real time under constraints etc. The topics covered in  this course will allow students to understand the basic concepts and  challenges related to dynamic multi-agent systems via several  experimentations on UAVs formations.    Experiments in the flight arena of CentraleSupélec on Crazyflie UAVs and  onTurtleBot ground autonomous vehicles (GAVs), and on the Robotarium  remote platform are planned as part of this course.          Quarter number  SG8     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)   Control Theory  (ST5)     Syllabus   This course is based on a collaboration with ONERA and the Heudiasyc  laboratory and has the following structure:    71      •  Introduction: a brief history, industrial and academic context;  •  Dynamic modeling of multi-agent systems (MAS);  •  Specific tools for MAS: notions of vehicles fleet/swarm,   communication graph, consensus;   •  Modeling and handling of Crazyflie drones and ground vehicles;  •  Control techniques of multi-agent systems;  •  Taking into account constraints in the cooperative control law;  •  Refinement of control laws and analysis of results;  •  Multi-agent systems in space missions.   A tutored case study is envisaged as a guideline throughout this course in  order to validate the proposed control techniques both in simulation and  on an indoor experiment of a fleet of Crazyflie UAVs and/or Turtlebot  mobile robots.    Experiments are planned in the indoor flight arena of CentraleSupélec.  See experiments en 2022:  https://twitter.com/centralesupelec/status/1535211296240685057       Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)   This course is composed of interactive lectures, tutorials and a case study  (carried out by team on a subject proposed by the students) that will serve  as a guideline throughout this elective module and will lead to indoor  experimentations on UAVs formations and mobile robots formations. The  case study will follow the progress of the course and will allow acquiring  practical skills. Active learning methods such as Problem-Based Learning  (PBL) in small tutored groups are envisaged for the case studies on UAVs  formations.  Students will discover dynamic multi-agent systems through various  examples, exercises, discussions, and theoretical and practical guidance. An  estimate of the hourly volume (35h) is as follows: 18h for interactive  lectures, 6h for tutorials, 9h for the case study and 2h for the evaluation of  interactive posters and peer assessment.       Grading   The evaluation procedure is designed to respect the alignment of  objectives - activities - evaluations. A report (containing a state-of-the-art,  the analysis of the results obtained during the case study, etc.) will be  delivered and evaluated. The results will be presented using an interactive  poster in front of a committee and with a cross-examination of the other  groups (peer assessment). The final grade is computed from the report  evaluation (40%), the interactive poster evaluation, both poster design and  presentation (40%) and the simulation & experimentation validation (20%).  A skill-based assement is also envisaged.   72           Course support, bibliography  References    •  A Massive Open Online Course on Drones and Aerial Multi Robot   Systems (DroMOOC), www.onera.fr/dromooc, University Paris-Saclay,  2018.   •  K.K.
