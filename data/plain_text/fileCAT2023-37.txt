   2EL1730 - Machine Learning       Instructors: Nora Ouzir  Department: DÉPARTEMENT MATHÉMATIQUES  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Fundamental Sciences  Advanced level : Yes      Description    Machine learning is the scientific field that provides computers the ability to  learn  without  being  explicitly  programmed  (definition  by  Wikipedia).  Machine learning lies at the heart of many real-world applications, including  recommender systems, web search, computer vision, autonomous cars and  automatic language translation.   The  course  will  provide  an  overview  of  fundamental  topics  as  well  as  important  trends  in  machine  learning,  including algorithms  for  supervised  and  unsupervised  learning,  dimensionality  reduction  methods  and  their  applications. A substantial lab section will involve group projects on a data  science  competition  and  will  provide  the  students  the  ability to apply  the  course theory to real-world problems.       Quarter number  SG6     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)     Notions of linear algebra, probabilities, and scientific programming in  Python (numpy).          Syllabus  The course will cover the following topics:      •  Introduction to Machine Learning  •  Model selection and evaluation   •  Linear and logistic regression   •  Probabilistic classifiers and linear discriminant analysis    128      •  Non-parametric learning and nearest neighbour methods   •  Tree-based methods and ensemble learning   •  Support Vector Machines   •  Neural networks  •  Dimensionality reduction  •  Unsupervised learning: clustering   •  Introduction to reinforcement learning    More details about the syllabus of the will be given in the website of the  course: http://fragkiskos.me/teaching/2E1730-F22/       Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)    •  Lectures (12 sessions x 1h30)  •  Labs (10 sessions x 1h30)  •  Written exam (2 hours)        Grading    The evaluation of the course will be based on the following:Two  assignments: the assignments will include theoretical questions as well  hands-on practical questions that will familiarize the students with basic  machine learning tasks.Project: The students are expected to form groups  of 3-4 people, propose a topic for their project, and submit a final project  report. Final exam: Final exam in the material covered in the course.The  grading will be as follows: Assignment 1 (individually):10%; Assignment 2  (individually):10%; Project (groups of 3-4 students):20%; Final exam:60%     Course support, bibliography     There is no single requiered textbook for the course. We will recommend  specific chapters from the following books:      •  Shai Shalev-Shwartz and Shai Ben-David. Understanding Machine  Learning: From Theory to Algorithms.
