   ST5 - 55 - LIGHT AND MATTER : DEVELOPMENT OF   HIGH TECHNOLOGY INSTRUMENTS     Dominante : PNT (Physics & NanoTechnology)  Langue d’enseignement : French  Campus où le cours est proposé : Paris-Saclay        Engineering problem  Modern physics has many outlets through the control of the properties of  matter and its functional engineering. In this ST, students will be confronted  with the problem of innovation and product development when it is a hightech instrument using physics, developed in small series for research or R&D.  In particular, the students will answer the following questions   - how to qualify and respond to a customer need in this context?  - which approach to design, realization and evolution to implement?  - how to design a solution for an intermediate customer who has customers  with various needs?  The  integration  courses  concern  devices  at  the  cutting  edge  of  physics  requiring  a  real  engineering  approach  since  the  theoretical  concepts  are  applied  to  real  devices  that  must  integrate  elements  of  feasibility  both  technical and economic.     Adviced prerequisites   It is recommended to have taken the SPI course of Wave Physics or Transfer  Science    Context and issue modules:  This part is structured around half-day training  sessions  aimed  at  presenting  the  sequence,  the  integration  lessons  and  introducing  the  theme.  The  following  lectures/presentations  will  be  organized:  - Presentation of the theme and its challenges  - Round-table discussion on professions: What is a physics engineer?   - Visit of a company   - Presentation of the EI   Specific course (60 HEE): Physics of Matter   Brief  description:  The  course  will  provide  students  with  a  basic  understanding of the physics of solid state matter. Crystallography and wave  diffraction (especially X-rays), lattice vibrations (phonons, thermal effects),  electronic  states  (Sommerfeld  model,  band  theory),  as  well  as  specific  topics: semiconductors, defects, superconductivity will be covered. The goal   402      is  to  show  students  that  the  understanding  and  control  of  material  properties requires studies at the microscopic scale.   Challenge Week n°1 : Synchrotron Beamline Design   -  Associated  partners:  European  Synchrotron  Radiation  Facility  (ESRF,  Grenoble),  SOLEIL  synchrotron  (Brookhaven, USA)   (Gif-sur-Yvette),  NSLS   synchrotron   - Location: Paris-Saclay campus   - Brief description:   The objectives are the following:  -  To  dimension  a  device  using  basic  (modern)  physics  notions  and  to  do  functional modeling.   - Identify the relevant heat transfers, model them, and size these systems.  - Know the key points of a pre-project study in a multidisciplinary context  - Have realistic orders of magnitude on the standard mechanical and physical  properties of "common" materials.  -  Carry  out  a  preliminary  design  of  the  scientific  instruments  studied,  justifying the choices made.  -  Work  in  a  team,  know  and  be  able  to  identify  the  different  roles  of  the  members  of  a  team,  lead  and  coordinate a work  group,  collect  and  share  information, format and present the work done (express oneself in front of  an audience / defense)   Challenge Week n°2 : Quantum cascade lasers   - Associated partners: Airbus Defence and Space, Thales   - Location: Paris-Saclay campus   -  Brief  description:  Quantum  cascade  lasers  are  nano  devices  invented  about  20  years  ago.  Engineering  miracles, their operation  has been  made  possible by the latest advances in quantum mechanics, optics and thermics.  Due to their very small size, operating wavelength and precision, they are a  technological  solution  of  choice  for  the  detection  of  minute  traces  of  pollutants as well as high-speed communications in free space.   In a team work, the students will be brought to familiarize themselves with  these  notions  and  to  acquire  the  mathematical  elements  necessary  to  numerically  model  the  behavior  of  these  systems.  They  will  have  to  implement  an  engineering  approach  to  transform  their  theoretical  knowledge into an object constrained by the reality of the world.      403
