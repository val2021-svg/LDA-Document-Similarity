   ST5 - 59 - ASSISTANCE AND AUTONOMY OF THE   PERSON     Dominante : VSE (Living-Health-Environment) and ENE (Energy)  Langue d’enseignement : French  Campus où le cours est proposé : Metz        Engineering problem   This  thematic  sequence  deals  with  the  design  of  motorized  assistance  systems  for  people  with  reduced  mobility,  whatever  their  nature,  in  its  technical, economic and ergonomic aspects. This issue, which has a strong  societal  impact,  is  at  the  heart  of  two  concerns.  Firstly,  the  ageing  of  the  population is increasing the need for this type of system. In addition, due to  the evolution of low-cost on-board computer systems, it is now possible to  offer increasingly complex functionalities, allowing the spectrum of services  provided to be broadened, ranging from motor servoing to more advanced  control (trajectory calculation, obstacle avoidance) or even connected and  communicating systems.   For  example,  a  very  common  device  nowadays  is  the  wheelchair  to  help  people  with  reduced  mobility  (paralysis  of  the  legs).  These  chairs  can  be  simply mechanical or electrically assisted. Reimbursed by the social security,  they are medical devices subject to approval.   Beyond the technical problems, one must also consider the cost (in France  the price is fixed by the social security) and the ergonomics. Experiments are  taking place on systems that could be different, such as exoskeletons.   Adviced prerequisites   None     Context and issue modules: this part is structured in conferences and round  table  allowing  to  apprehend  the  problematic,  the  technologies  and  the  stakes of the devices related to the person:  -  Environment,  type  of  pathology,  manual  and  electric  wheelchairs.  Homologation  - How to improve people's lives  - Demonstration of wheelchairs, technological locks, innovation     Specific course (60 HEE): Control of a motorization chain   Short  description  :  This  course  deals  with  the  notions  necessary  for  the  control of a motorization chain in its electronic aspects (converters, power,   457      supply), servo control (modeling, observers, regulators) and digital (analogdigital  conversion,  programming,  real  time).  The  practical  aspects  will  be  tested  on  microcontroller  boards  in  order  to  implement  a  speed  control  system for a DC motor.   Challenge Week : Design of a motorized wheelchair for people with reduced  mobility   Associated  partner:  Logosilver  Company,  CERAH  (Center  for  Study  and  Research on the Fitting of the Handicapped)   - Location: Metz campus   - Brief description : A wheelchair for a person with reduced mobility must  ensure a minimum level of safety set by standards. Mechanical design and  motor control work together to achieve this safety. The confrontation of the  students with the normative and security aspects at the same time as with  the  mechanical  and electronic/computer  technical  aspects  opens them to  the multidisciplinary dimension. The specificity of this integration course is  the consideration of safety in technical designs. In addition, as current trends  are for all objects to be increasingly "connected", functions of this type will  be  considered  (steering  the  chair  from  a  smartphone,  steering  the  house  from the chair, etc.).   This integration course is designed to lead to the concrete realization of a  wheelchair.  The  whole  is  a  mini-project  sequenced  in  individual  thematic  sessions  (mechanics,  electronics,  computer  science,  automation...).  The  themes can be variable according to the groups of students (not all groups  do all the themes) and will follow a schedule allowing to arrive at the end at  an operational chair.         458
