The aim is to develop  these innovative products in an optimal way by controlling the energy of the  waves by the geometry of the wall while taking into account the economic  constraints. For example, COLAS and École Polytechnique have developed  an anti-noise wall called "Fractal Wall" TM, which was designed empirically  with  complex  geometry  to  dissipate  different  wavelengths.  However,  this  wall even if it is four times more efficient than conventional walls for low  frequencies,  is  almost  not  sold  ...  The  explanation  is  that  its  construction,  being by demolding, may break the wall, this which results in a high cost of  manufacture.  This  IS  proposes  to  find  by  wave  control  methods  optimal  forms  that  are  as  absorbent  as  possible  (in  decibels)  that  satisfy  the  constraints imposed by the manufacturer, for example, the least expensive  manufacturing  cost  with  the  greatest  reduction.  important  decibels.  First  numerical  results  in  this  context  show  the  existence  of  optimal  "not  too  complex" forms capable of improving the performance of the "Fractal wall"  by a factor of 6.

Adapt your "digital behavior" to the  context: use and development of a numerical code based on existing parts.    C7.1 Convince on the merits. Be clear about the objectives and the  expected results. Be rigorous about the assumptions and the approach.  Structure your ideas and your argumentation. Highlight the created value.  To convince while working on the relation to the other: by working in team  the strategic choice is crucial to have good results of the project, to do it it  is necessary to be able to convince the others; teamwork itself; the final  defense before a multi-disciplinary jury.   439
