   2EL1315 - Electrical Energy Conversion for renewable   energy sources and electromobility       Instructors: Marc Petit  Department: DÉPARTEMENT SYSTÈMES D'ÉNERGIE ÉLECTRIQUE  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Engineering Sciences  Advanced level : Yes        Description     Considering the decarbonation objectives at worldwide level, the European  Commission has planned an ambitious program to reach a net zero emission  in 2050. In that way, several scenarios have been built, among them a larger  electrification  of  the  energy  sector,  a  better  energy  efficiency,  and  development  of  hydrogen.  These  scenarios  have  been  also  organized  in  seven strategic priorities. Two of them are the development of renewable  energy (with a target of 80% of electricity generated from renewable sources  in  2050)  and  a  more  electrified  mobility.  Thus  electrical  (or  electromechanical) converters will be at the heart of this evolution, with the  following  applications:  windmills,  PV  generation,  battery  storage,  electric  powertrain for electric vehicles (EV), more electric aircrafts, all electric ships,  new DC lines for electrical grids, power converters for electrolysers and for  fuel-cells, energy harvesting for autonomous systems, …   Whatever  the  application,  an  important  step  will  be  the  design  of  the  optimal  solution  and  its  operation  in  a  complex  and  fully  interconnected  environment. Thus a deep understanding of the devices and sub-systems is  a key point. It means: what is the structure? how does it work? how can the  devices be connected together? how to design a more complex system with  several devices? How to model them for the optimization and the sizing?        Quarter number  SG8     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  basics about electrical circuits, 3-phase systems, and electrical powers    85        Syllabus    - Basics about electromechanical converters (AC machines) for generation  (wind turbine and hydro power plants) and motor applications (pumping,  electric propulsion). Modelling for the sizing, and for simulations   - Basics about power electronic converters for EV (battery BEV and plug-in  hybrid PHEV) charging, and electric propulsion (EV, ships, trains). Modelling  for the sizing, and for simulations.   - Applications:    a) Connection of an AC generator to an AC power network. Operating point  setting in the P,Q diagram.    b) Electronic power converters design for charging an EV battery         Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)  slides of the lecture (with their detailed and written comments)     Grading  75% of the mark is from a 2h individual examination (knowledge questions  + exercice)  25% of the mark is based on the lab session reports.        Resources  lectures (15h) + lab sessions (9h) + exercices (9h)     Learning outcomes covered on the course  Based on selected applications (such as charging system for EV battery,  variable speed drive for industrial application or electric propulsion,  electrical generator for hydro power plant), we aim at presenting the  basics about electromechanical converters and power electronic  converters.     Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course  The students will know the basic components to build some widely used  electric energy converters. They will be able to make a first sizing of such  system, and they will be able to analyze the integration of such system in a  wider environment  skills: C1.1 ; C1.2 ; C1.4   86
