   2SC5894 - Design and analysis of production systems for   smart factories       Instructors: Paolo Ballarini  Department: DOMINANTE - INFORMATIQUE ET NUMÉRIQUE  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 40  On-site hours (HPE): 27,00          Description   Recent developments in manufacturing engineering lead to the  formulation of dedicated new paradigms  such as Industry 4.0 (Germany)  and smart manufacturing (USA). The main idea behind these  novel  paradigms is that future production systems shall be capable to  fullfil individual customer requirements by flexibly adapting the production  outcome so to yield product variants in very small lot size. To this aim  manufacturing systems must become "smart" hence consisting of  intelligent machines, pieces and infrastuctures able to exchange and  process information so that the production process adapts itself to the  specific customer requirements. In this context modelling and performance  analysis of production processes becomes  fundamental. In this course we  are going to focus on formal modelling and performance analysis of  production processes whereby a number of fault-prone machines are  arranged in a given topology to yield a given final product. We are going to  analyse how relevant performance indicators are affected by different  aspects of the production systems and so to study the impact that system's  (re)configuration has on productivity.
