Besides, experiments with audio signal have the advantages of being quite  simple : the audio sources can easily be controlled (for instance using PC and  loudspeakers) and the data are usually acquired using microphones.     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  Signal Processing, Statistics and Learning     Syllabus  Three workshops will be addressed during this course.    Room acoustics, reverberation  The  sound  perceived  in  a  room  is  significantly  different  from  the  sound  emitted because of reverberations on the objects and walls of the room. The  reverberation effect can be modeled as the convolution of the emitted signal  with the impulse response of the room.  The objective of this workshop is to perform experimental measurements  and implement the processing to identify the impulse response of different  rooms in order to characterize the acoustic environment (e.g. estimation of  the reverberation time) and to synthesize realistic signals as they would be  heard in the room.    Source separation  Mixing  an  audio  recording  consists  of  mixing  different  audio  tracks  to  produce one mono track, two stereo tracks, or more (5.1, etc.). Conversely,  source  separation  aims  to  find  these  sources,  without  knowing  the  gains  used to generate the audio tracks, and with more sources than tracks. This  type  of  technique  can  be  used  to  unmix  a  music  recording  or  separate  speakers in a room.   663      Detection of noisy points (acoustic imaging)  Acoustic imaging consists of mapping the sound scene in order to obtain an  image where each pixel corresponds to the sound intensity emitted by the  acoustic  sources.  With  acoustic  imaging,  we  can  accurately  detect  the  position of noisy points on an object or in any acoustic scene.  This type of method requires a microphone array of significant size in order  to have a sufficient resolution. A network of 32 microphones will be available  for measurements.     Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)  Most of the time will be dedicated to practical work.  The theoretical contributions necessary to the understanding of the  physical phenomena and treatments will be carried out in the form of short  oral interventions of the teachers.     Grading  The work done will be evaluated during a defense in a group of three  students.      Resources  The acquisition systems will be made available to the students, and  software lib in python will also be provided for the most standard  processing.     Learning outcomes covered on the course  For each of the workshops, students will design a measurement protocol,  to carry it out and to process the signals. The goal is to develop a  methodology to validate the experimental results and evaluate the  performance of the proposed processing.
