   ST7 - 81 - ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING DESIGN     Dominante : CVT (Construction, City and Transportation)  Langue d’enseignement : English  Campus où le cours est proposé : Paris-Saclay        Engineering problem   Since its inception, additive manufacturing has proven to be a fundamental  change  in  manufacturing  processes,  allowing  total  customization  and  artisanal quality at the cost and precision of a modern industrialized process.  However, it is a young process, and therefore, not yet fully mastered. The  mechanical  properties  of  the  parts  produced  are  often  unpredictable,  severely  limiting  their  use  in  high-end  applications.  This  is  why  the  development  of  methods  (analytical  and  numerical)  capable  of  predicting  the final characteristics of the part by optimizing the design process seems  a necessity.   The  sequence  focuses  on  the  optimization  of  the  design  by  additive  manufacturing:  - Optimal choice of material and microstructure;  - Optimization of geometry with respect to multiphysical constraints;  -  Optimization  of process  parameters  (printing  path, laser power, powder  characteristics...)  - Evaluation of the economic and social stakes of FA compared to standard  processes  (manufacturing  time,  cost  of  materials,  labor  employed,  environmental compatibility...)   This design presents a major challenge due to the multiphysical nature of  the additive manufacturing process (thermal, mechanical, electromagnetic,  metallurgical, phase change) and poses a multiscale problem both in space  and in time (evolutionary nature of the process).        Advised prerequisites   It is advisable to have taken the SPI course "Mechanics of Continuous Media"  and  at  least  one  of  the  following  courses:  Materials,  Transfer  Science,  Thermodynamics.   Context and issue modules:    These modules include lectures, a study-case and a mini-project, aimed at  presenting the problem, the social and economic stakes and making a simple  object using 3D printing.        609      Specific course (60 HEE): Multiphysics coupling   Brief  Description:  This  course  will  address  the  concepts  and  issues  of  multiphysics coupling in a broad sense. The following topics, among others,  will be covered during the course:   - Strong - weak coupling  - Coupling of different formulations    - Coupling of different scales      Then  we  will  focus  on  particular  couplings,  of  interest  for  additive  manufacturing:  - Laser on powder: electro-thermal coupling  -  Powder  bed  melting:  discrete-continuous,  solid-fluid  and  thermomechanical  coupling  - Cooling phase: aerothermal-mechanical coupling      The  course  will  end  with  a  reflection  on  the  mechanics  of  the  final  part  (residual stress, porosity, microstructure...).  A strong emphasis is placed on practice through tutorials and a case study  on  the  multiphysics  simulation  software  COMSOL.  The  acquired  skills  are  evaluated by the case study.      Projects:   Brief description: The sequence is built around various projects carried out  by the CVT major. The students, in groups of 5 maximum, will have to answer  a problem proposed by their industrial partner around the design of a part  in  additive  manufacturing.  This  may  involve  optimizing  its  geometry,  thinking about its design, designing a system for a given use, analyzing the  performance of the part designed by additive manufacturing, etc. Most of  the topics involve finite element simulation on COMSOL or on the software  of the students' choice. Some topics may involve experimental work.      Step 1: Getting to know the subject    Step  2:  Simplified  representation  of  the  studied  part  to  arrive  at  a  solution   All projects should follow the following steps:  -   -  first  -  -  compared to an initial or classical solution.    Step 3: Optimization of the system in a given parameter space  Step  4:  Analysis  of  the  cost-benefit  of  the  proposed  solution      All these projects are gathered in 3 thematic groups:   610            Project  n°1:  Optimization  of  aeronautical  parts  manufacturing.
