   2EL2030 - Genomics and synthetic biology in health and   industrial biotechnology       Instructors: Behnam Taidi  Department: DÉPARTEMENT MÉCANIQUE ENERGÉTIQUE PROCÉDÉS  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Engineering Sciences  Advanced level : No      Description   The recent advent of high-throughput molecular biology techniques and the  in-depth  understanding  of  genetics  based  on  advances  in  sequencing  methods  have  overwhelmed  medical  and  industrial  biotechnology.  In  addition,  synthetic  biology  (where  novel  biological  and  biologically  based  parts, devices and systems are (re)designed and constructed to perform new  functions that do not exist in nature) has opened up a whole new field of  opportunities  where  the  engineers  interact  with  biologists,  chemists  and  computer  scientists  to  conceive  and  make  diagnostic  and  therapeutic  devices.  A course is provided for the students to immerse themselves in the universe  of genetics and synthetic biology where the latest concepts and industrial  applications are unveiled and discussed.  The  aim  of  this  course  is  to  teach  the  future  engineer  the  structure,  functioning  and  regulation of  the  genome  and how this  can be related  to  industrial  and  medical  applications.  In  addition,  by  learning  the  nature  of  analogue signals and digital genetic data, the engineer will be able to choose  the most pertinent methods for data processing and interpretation. This will  transform the pool of information into informative knowledge that could be  used for the provision of new products and services.  Thus, at the end of the course, students will have a strategic vision on how  to  progress  in  the  field  of  genomics  and  synthetic  biology:  from  the  exploration  of  unprecedented  data  accumulation  to  the  extraction  of  innovative knowledge and the transformation of the data into new rational  and useful knowledge.      Quarter number  SG6     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  An interest in Biology and modelling biological phenomena.  General notions of biology at the level of general knowledge.   166         Syllabus  The syllabus consists of four modules; two of these are common  foundation courses that pave the way for the subsequent two modules  that focus on the application of synthetic biology to human health and the  industrial biotechnology business.     Introduction: Genome structure and regulation, cloning techniques,  Synthetic Biology  Genomic analyses by high-throughput methods: From genomic DNA  to RNA  Human health applications: Modifying and reprogramming the  genome as a basis for gene and cellular therapy, based on stem cells  and induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSC).  Industrial-Biotechnology applications:  Engineering the genome, the  cellular chassis, allocation of resources, circuits engineering, metabolic  engineering, the role of computer aided design in synthetic biology  and metabolic engineering, introduction to iGEM          Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)  The course module is organized in lectures, to introduce knowledge and  methodological tools     Grading  Continuous assessment for the lectures given by Marie-Anne DEBILY so  attendance is obligatory for all these lectures that cover half of the course.  Final written exam of 2 hours duration (no documents and no computer  allowed) for the second half of the lectures.       Course support, bibliography  Course slides available online     Resources   • Teaching staff (instructor(s) names): Behnam TAIDI (CS-LGPM), MarieAnne Debily (Gustave Roussy), Jean Loup FAULON (INRA), Ioana POPESCU  (University of Evry-val-d’Essonne), Matthieu JULES (AgroParisTech)  • Maximum enrollment : 40  • Equipment-specific classrooms : Computer room equipped with desktop  (Linux or Windows OS) for a 4 hour module  - Contrôle continu pour une partie du cours avec un examen final de 2  heures pour la seconde moitié du cours.     167           Learning outcomes covered on the course   On completion of the course, students should be able to:   •  aware of technical tools and developments that enable to better   understand how  genomes are structured and have a control action   •  understand the contributions of genomes to one’s identity and   understand the general principles that drive physiologic and  pathologic immune evolution   •  appreciate how genomic information can be used for developing   •  learn about the current status of stem cells and the new   improved therapeutics   therapeutic developments   •  have a strategic vision of the way to get ahead in the field of   genomics: from data mining to the extraction of innovative  knowledge        Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course   C1.1. : Examine problems in their entirety and beyond their immediate  parameters. Identify, formulate and analyse the scientific, economic and  human dimensions of a problem Milestone 1  C1.2. : Develop and use appropriate models, choosing the correct  modelling scale and simplifying assumptions when addressing a problem  Milestone 1  C1.4.  : Design, detail and corroborate a whole or part of a complex system.
