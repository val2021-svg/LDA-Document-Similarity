   2EL1590 - Cloud computing and distributed computing       Instructors: Francesca Bugiotti, Gianluca Quercini  Department: DÉPARTEMENT INFORMATIQUE  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Fundamental Sciences  Advanced level : Yes      Description  Nowadays,  the  marketing  strategies  of  most  companies  is  based  on  the  analysis  of  massive  and  heterogeneous  data  that  needs  a  considerable  amount of computational power. Instead of purchasing new hardware and  software infrastructures, companies often resort to the computational and  storage power offered by cloud computing platforms over the Internet.   The  objective  of  this  course  is  to  present  the  fundamental  principles  of  distributed systems and distributed computing that are at the heart of cloud  computing.   The course will cover the principles of virtualization and containerization and  the  methods  and  tools  used  for  distributed  processing  (for  instance,  MapReduce, HDFS, and Spark).   The course will also introduce advanced techniques and algorithms for the  analysis of massive and heterogeneous data (PageRank, supervised learning,  and clustering) and a brief introduction to some optimized Spark-compliant  data formats (i.e., Parquet).       Quarter number  SG8     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  Python programming, databases, basics of networking will be appreciated.
