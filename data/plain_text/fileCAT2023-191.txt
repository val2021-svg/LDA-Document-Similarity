   2SC7990 - What you unwittingly say: decryption and   automatic analysis of nonverbal behaviors       Instructors: Catherine Soladie  Department: DOMINANTE - MATHÉMATIQUES, DATA SCIENCES, DOMINANTE -  INFORMATIQUE ET NUMÉRIQUE, DOMINANTE - VIVANT, SANTÉ,  ENVIRONNEMENT  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE RENNES  Workload (HEE): 80  On-site hours (HPE): 48,00      Description    What you unwittingly say: decryption and automatic analysis of  nonverbal behaviors.   Letters, words, sentences: the algorithms we have today are more and more  effective in decrypting our grammar, and understanding what we can say.  And yet this only covers a tiny part of our communication.   Joy, resignation, irony: only our body and the tone of our voice reveal our  deep  intentions,  our  real  message,  and  the  automated  understanding  of  such human behaviors and emotions is a big challenge.   To take it up, every year, the audio, video and machine learning communities  gather  around  international  challenges  of  research  on  the  automatic  analysis  of  human  behaviors:  emotions,  depression,  mood,  motion  detection, ... (ex: http://sspnet.eu/avec2017/).   Through this project, you will be able to face one of these challenges. You  will  have  a  large  dataset  representing  people  in  action  and  will  have  to  automatically determine their behavior and emotions.   Each project team focuses on a particular study (eg the voice, the face, ...),  and all teams will gather their work to compare your results to those of the  competitors of the international challenge.
