   2IN5050 - Discovery of software defined radio       Instructors: Jacques ANTOINE  Department: DÉPARTEMENT SIGNAL, INFORMATION, COMMUNICATION  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 40  On-site hours (HPE): 27,00          Description  The radio spectrum is a rare resource shared worldwide by many players for  various applications (broadcasting of multimedia content, Internet of Things,  5G,  satellite  radio  navigation  systems,  transport,  etc.).  This  experimental  module aims to allow students to immerse themselves in the world of radio  and discover the underlying technologies through practice by participating  in a challenge that consists of decoding broadcast signals.      Quarter number  Intensive week SG6 and SG8     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  Signal processing, Modeling, Python. This elective may be an opportunity to  put into practice concepts covered in other elective courses (which it is not  necessary  to  have  followed):  Principles  of  wireless  telecommunications,  From  information  theory  to  IoT  networks,  Electronic  Systems  ,  Theory  of  communications, Mobile communications networks.    Syllabus  A first part of the experimental module is devoted to the discovery of the  radio  spectrum  and  radiocommunication  systems.  It  introduces  the  key  concepts  of  software  defined  radio  (SDR,  Software  Defined  Radio).  The students have at their disposal two SDR type cards to design and build a  transmitter and a receiver, validate it and test its performance. The objective  is to learn all the steps necessary to transform data into a modulated signal,  emit it and then detect the signals to decode the useful information, both  from a theoretical point of view and functional and hardware architecture.    Secondly, a challenge will be issued to the students: choose a broadcasting   661      system and decode the corresponding signals; for example name of an FM(*)  station (RDS(*) system) or position of a civil aircraft (ADS-B(*) system).    (*)ADS-B: Automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast; FM: Frequency  Modulation; RDS: Radio Data System.     Schedule for the week:  • Introduction to SDR technology  • Contribution on terrestrial broadcasting systems and on the use of  the radio spectrum  • Contribution on digital modulations and realization of a transmission  between two SDR cards  • Challenges: choosing a broadcasting and decoding system      to   the   chosen   decode   broadcast   Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)  Practical work fed by some theoretical contributions.     Grading  A  report  will  be  submitted  on  the  experimental  work  carried  out.  A  presentation will be made at the end of the challenge to explain the choices  made  system.     Course support, bibliography  Presentation of the standards studied. Course complements.     Resources  Teaching staff: Jacques Antoine, Raul De Lacerda  Software (GNU radio) and hardware (SDR card) tools.     Learning outcomes covered on the course  At the end of this course, students will be able to design and implement  wireless digital communication systems from software radio cards. They  will be familiar with the main parameters and the operation of a digital  transmission chain.
