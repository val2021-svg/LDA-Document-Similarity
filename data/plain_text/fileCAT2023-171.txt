   2SC7410 - Decision Support : Models, algorithms and   implementation       Instructors: Vincent Mousseau  Department: DÉPARTEMENT GÉNIE INDUSTRIEL ET OPÉRATIONS  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 34,50      Description  Decision  making  is  an  intrinsic  activity  in  the  engineering  profession  and  often leads to optimize one or more aspects of a system. But these decisions  are  also  based  on  the  judgments/preferences  of  a  decision-maker/user.  Preferences have therefore played a key role in many computer applications  and  modern  information  technologies.  This  is  the  case  of  computer  marketing, recommendation systems, adaptive user interfaces, ... Decisions  can  be  strategic,  tactical  or  dynamic,  in  complex,  competitive,  uncertain,  optimize or find a compromise between conflicting criteria ... To solve the  complex  decision  problems  between  them,  they  must  be  confronted,  the  engineers  must  implement  the  concepts  and  methods  and  algorithms  to  formalize a problem of decision.

Mousseau + chargés de TD/TP à valider)  Software: Python + optimisation solvers + metaheuristics libraries  TD: ~30 students  TP: ~20 students  Wifi ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED for TD and TD       Learning outcomes covered on the course    This  course  aims  to  develop  students'  abilities  to  develop  and  implement  models and algorithms relevant to a decision-making situation.   At the end of the course, students will master some methods / models for  decision support. They will be able to manipulate models, use them in an  operational  way  and  implement  them  efficiently.  They  will  also  have  the  necessary elements to take a step back and have a critical sense in relation  to these methods, and thus to distinguish their performances and their limits  of application.   526           Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course    C1 (all sub-competences): Analysis, design and implementation of complex  systems made up of scientific, technological, social and economic  dimensions.  C2.1: Thoroughly master a domain or discipline based on the fundamental  sciences or the engineering sciences.  C2.3: Rapidly identify and acquire the new knowledge and skills necessary  in applicable / relevant domains, be they technical, economic or others.  C6.3: Conceive, design, implement and authenticate complex software.  C6.4: Solve problems through mastery of computational thinking skills.  C6.5: Operate all types of data, structured or unstructured, including big  data.   527
