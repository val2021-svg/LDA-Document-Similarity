   2SC6110 - Photonics for the control of physical systems       Instructors: Nicolas Marsal  Department: CAMPUS DE METZ  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE METZ  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 34,50        Description  This course will teach the basic knowledges of the measurement and  exploitation of the physical quantities of optical electromagnetic waves, in  the context of the exploitation of photonics for the observation and control  of physical systems.  It will focus on:   •  Optical metrology  •  Photonic technologies including semiconductor materials and   optical fibers, phase and intensity modulation   •  Signal analysis exploiting in particular the non-linear dynamics of a   physical system   •  Properties and regulation of non-linear systems      Quarter number  ST5     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  Basic knowledge of electromagnetism, materials, electricity and  electronics.     Syllabus   •  Optical measurement and instrumentation: generalities in metrology   and error analysis, photometry, and optical detectors, holographic  metrology, velocimetry, interferometry.   •  Laser source technologies: additions to solid state physics, materials   •  Modeling and control of sources: analysis and non-linear dynamics of   and semiconductors.   laser sources.   •  Generation of optical signals: spatial and temporal modulation   techniques of optical signals; engineering and optical beam design.    472           Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)  30h00 lectures and 3h00 practical exercices       Resources  Lecturers: Nicolas Marsal, Delphine Wolfersberger, Marc Sciamanna     Learning outcomes covered on the course  Thanks to this course, students will learn the physical quantities and tools  which allow to spatially characterize optical beams, to analyze their  frequencies, to modulate their intensities, their phases to guide them in  different physical systems (fiber, waveguide ...)  They will see the linear and non-linear dynamics associated with those  beams when they propagate in different materials and / or physical  systems.  Thanks to this course and in addition to the EI, the student will be able to  physically design a LIDAR, to test its performance and to compare it with  other equipment used in optical metrology.     Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course   C1 Analyze, design,and buildcomplex systems with scientific, technological,  human, and economic components  C2 Develop in-depth skills in an engineering field and a family of  professions   473
