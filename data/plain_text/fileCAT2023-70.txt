   2EL2630 - Applications of statistical and quantum   physics to information science   the   learning,   semantic  web,       Instructors: Zeno Toffano  Department: DÉPARTEMENT SIGNAL, INFORMATION, COMMUNICATION  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Fundamental Sciences  Advanced level : Yes      Description  This  course  is  an  opening  to  mathematical,  informational  and  statistical  theories and methods issued from statistical and quantum physics used in  information  science.    These methods are currently applied in many fields related to information  image  processing,  processing,  neural  networks  and  deep  telecommunications,  intelligence,  computational biology… but also more generally in the humanities and social  sciences with, for example, applications in natural language processing and  in  finance.    The  notions  of  entropy  and  information  are  central  to  this  approach.  For  example, the study of disordered spin systems is applied to the processing  of discrete information and statistical inference with important applications  for example in telecommunications. More recently, operational techniques  using quantum information have shown their advantage over conventional  methods,  the  emblematic  example  being  the  quantum  computer.    The purpose of the course, which is transdisciplinary in nature, is to establish  connections between the training in mathematics and physics and advanced  technological applications, such as digital communications, data processing,  algorithmic learning and also quantum computation and information. It is  intended for students wishing to familiarize themselves with research and  engineering  topics  in  top  scientific  and  technological  fields  in  a  digital  environment.
