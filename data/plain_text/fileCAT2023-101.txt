   2EL6150 - Model-based predictive control       Instructors: Romain Bourdais  Department: CAMPUS DE RENNES  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE RENNES  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Engineering Sciences  Advanced level : Yes      Description   Model  Predictive  Control  (MPC) is  the  advanced  control technic  the  most  used  for  engineering  systems.  Its  industrial  use  is  booming  because  it  optimizes the operation of an industrial process, its energy efficiency while  integrating operating constraints. However, it is still the subject of a large  number of scientific publications, even if the last concerns of the scientific  community remain very theoretical.    This  course  presents  the  main  principles  of  the  predictive  control  in  a  precise,  readable  and  intuitive  mathematical  formalism  and  which  is  not  reserved  for  the  automation  engineers  -  The  predictive  control  will  be  treated in depth and in all the aspects of the automatic in the mention of 3rd  year "Control Engineering" - After an introduction to the basic concepts of  the MPC, this course is built around many case studies, where they will be  applied both in simulation and in practice for different industrial processes.  In  this  course,  it  is therefore  a question  of  providing decision  and  control  tools that exploit a model of the system in order to improve its efficiency.  Expectations  in  terms  of  efficiency  are  translated  into  a  mathematical  multicriteria  that  must  be  minimized.  The  model  can  be  derived  from  a  mathematical  representation  of  the  considered  system,  in  which  case  conventional  methods  (deterministic,  linear programming  for  example, or  explicit  resolution)  of  optimization  can  be  used.  The  optimization  process  can also use a simulator of the studied system, which must then use heuristic  techniques.    The applications will focus on energy management in an eco-district and the  exploitation  of  such  techniques  for  the  sizing  of  energy  production  or  storage systems.

Group work of 3/5  students. This first case study aims at integrating a set of complex  heterogeneous systems into an energy manager.    •  Data analysis and bibliographic analysis  •  Design of a power management system, integrating energy and power   constraints   variables   •  Integration of mixed processes: continuous and with decision   •  Development of a performance evaluation simulator  •  Written exam     Case Study 2: Dimensioning and predictive management of a solar  production and an electrical storage for the energy independence of an  isolated site (1h lecture, 5h laboratory work, 18h homework, 1 oral  presentation of the results). This second case study incorporates an  economic dimension coupled with risk-taking in the management of  uncertainties.    •  Data analysis and bibliographic analysis  •  Integration of uncertainty (weather phenomena, random   consumption)   •  Compromise search: investment in infrastructure and strong active   management capability   •  Return on investment calculation   329      •  Assessment of the comforts (satisfaction of the requests)  •  Risk analysis  •  Team Challenge - Presentation and Peer Review        Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)  This module is built on very few theoretical courses. Practical work is at the  heart of this module, which combines both model experiments (industrial  wind tunnel) and technical-economic studies where theoretical content is  used as a basis for decision-making.
