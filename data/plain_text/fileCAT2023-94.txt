2EL6060 - Serious Game          Instructors: Catherine Soladie  Department: CAMPUS DE RENNES  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE RENNES  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Fundamental Sciences  Advanced level : Yes      Description      What if you save the world from your console?     The game, and especially the video game, is a fascinating medium. You have  certainly experienced a maximum concentration, facing a screen or a board,  hours  that  we  no  longer  feel,  challenges  and  limits  that  are  crossed  and  exceeded. The game does not announce its ideas, it makes them live. The  game does not explain, it implies.    Today, this strength of the game shows us that it is possible to go beyond  mere  entertainment:  more  and  more,  it  allows  to  transmit  knowledge,  know-how,  ecological or  social  awareness,  ...  In short, the  game becomes  seriously useful, from industry to classrooms.    In this elective, you will discover how the serious game has transformed the  transmission  of  ideas  in  many  areas,  from  learning  to  read  to  car  repair,  through  education  to  gestures  of  care.  These  examples  will  allow  you  to  become  a  designer  of  your  own  serious  game,  because  your  ideas  also  deserve to be playable.
