   2SC8210 - Optimization for neuro-inspired computing   with physical architectures       Instructors: Damien Rontani  Department: CAMPUS DE METZ  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE METZ  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 34,50          Description     The ever-increasing amount of data generated requires the development of  novel  processing/analyzing  strategies.  Automatic  classification  techniques  originating  from the field  of  Machine  Learning  are  a  promising  candidate,  however,  their  digital  implementations  remain  relatively  low  and  energyintensive.  An  alternate  solution  consists  of  designing  physical  (hardware)  neuro-inspired architecture that allows the alleviation of parts if not all of  these technological challenges. This theme is the current focus of research  laboratories worldwide and has caught the attention of large technological  groups such as IBM or Google.    In this particular context and through the framework of reservoir computing,  which consists of an artificial neural network trained only at its final output  layer,  This  module  proposes  to  the  students  to  discover  the  principle  of  conception and design physical (hardware) neuronal networks. Toward this,  the students will be familiarized with various optimization techniques such  as  ridge  regression  or  gradient  descent  and  their  accelerated  versions,  or  stochastic heuristics (ex. simulated annealing, genetic algorithms...).
