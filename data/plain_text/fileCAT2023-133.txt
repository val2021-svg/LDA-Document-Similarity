   2SC5710 - Theory and algorithmics for wave control       Instructors: Anna Rozanova-Pierrat  Department: DÉPARTEMENT MATHÉMATIQUES  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 34,50          Description   Acoustic pollution is today considered a major annoyance by the population,  while  electromagnetic  pollution  raises  many  questions  and  questions  related to health problems. Practical achievements to control this pollution  represent a major technical and industrial challenge, but do not yet benefit  from  the  new  developments  that  mathematical  analysis,  numerical  simulation and computer science can bring to it.    This  course  focuses  on  the  design  of  innovative  products  (acoustic  or  electromagnetic  coating)  intended  to  control  acoustic  /  electromagnetic  pollution.  Having  introduced  the  physical  context  in  the  "Context  and  challenges"  module, it aims to give students the concepts in mathematics and computer  science associated with the design and manufacture of such products. This  course offers two training paths:   1)  Theoretical  analysis  path,  directed  by  Ms.  Rozanova-Pierrat:  a  path  based  on  mathematical theory  (EDPs,  functional  analysis, derived from  Fréchet)  to master the control of waves to define the form of an acoustic  or electromagnetic coating. In particular, in this way are treated the EDPs  on  the  irregular  edges  (fractals)  and  is  developed  the  method  of  optimization of the forms and the concept of the derivative compared to  the boundary.    2) Digital analysis path, numerical and algorithmic methods, directed by  M.  Magoulès:  this  path  aims  to  deepen  the  numerical  methods,  it  is  oriented  towards  scientific  calculation.  In  particular,  in  this  way  are  treated the numerical methods and the implementation of these for the  propagation of the waves and the method of optimization of the forms.      The  two  tracks  prepare  for  the  three  EIs  proposed  subsequently.  More  precisely,  they  study  the  methods  (theoretical  or  numerical)  which  are  useful for the themes of the three EIs: for controlling external acoustic waves  (near motorways, airports, construction sites) or internal (sound insulation  in  offices  by  perforated  panels  or  acoustic  liners  in  aircraft  reactors  for   432      example), as well  as  in the  control  of electromagnetic  pollution  (anechoic  chambers).     Quarter number  ST5     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)    Knowledge of SG courses of the 1st year: Algorithmics and complexity (for  the Scientific Computing track) and EDPs (for the Mathematical Methods  track)   SPI course "Wave Physics" is recommended for the EI "Electromagnetic  pollution control"        Syllabus   The  control  problems  described  by  partial  differential  equations  (observability, controllability, controllability) are developed in the course of  the "Automatique et Contrôle" of the ST, which is further explored in the  context  of  the  control  of  the  dissipation  of  the  wave  energy.  The  observability in this case depends on the geometry of the absorbing edge.  To illustrate the reasons for requiring geometric irregularity, we introduce  the notions of fractal geometry with known results in physics (for two tracks)  and  mathematics  (for  the  track  "Theoretical  analysis").  In  particular,  we  present the phenomena of localization and absorption of waves (acoustic or  electromagnetic) which are connected by the spectral analysis of the model.  To better understand the environmental and sociological issues of acoustic  barrier development, we present some psychoacoustic aspects, which show  the importance of the dissipation of certain frequencies. The course studies  in particular, for a fixed frequency, obtaining an optimal form for a frequency  model on the Helmholtz equations in order to allow its use in the IE on two  types  of  controls:  geometric  and  topological.  We  then  consider  the  main  difficulty  of  having  an  "almost  optimal"  shape  over  a  wide  band  of  frequencies, important from a psychoacoustic point of view and industrial  interests.  In  this  context  are  also  presented  the  most  suitable  numerical  methods (thoroughly for the track "Scientific computing") in order to quickly  and robustly determine the optimal shape or the "almost optimal" shape of  the geometry on a frequency band by numerical simulation.

Each group has courses intended to introduce concepts used in TDs  and  in  the  longer  term  in  IE  (the  three  IEs  offered).  There  will  be  some  courses on numerical methods in the mathematical way and there will be  some basic theoretical courses (such as multidimensional integration) in the  numerical way. It is planned to have a session of TPs (TDs on the computer)  of 3h common for 2 channels at the end of which there is a digital project to  render (the influence of the geometry of the wall on the localization of the  eigen  modes  and  dissipation  of  wave  energy).  Students  will  perform  modeling,  simulation,  visualization  and  rendering  of  the  phenomenon.  To  validate  the  Numerical  Analysis  track  there  is  a  numerical  project  and  to  validate  the  Mathematical  Analysis  track  there  is  an  written  exam  of  1.5  hours.  The  Mathematical  Analysis  track  is  based  on  the  course  handout,  which will be made available to everyone. Students of two tracks also have   435      at their disposal all the subjects of the TDs with the corrections. Numerical  calculations will be performed on a CentraleSupélec calculation cluster by  connecting to Jupyter.
