   2EL1110 - Dynamical systems in neuroscience       Instructors: Antoine Chaillet  Department: DÉPARTEMENT AUTOMATIQUE  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Engineering Sciences  Advanced level : Yes      Description  This course constitutes an introduction to tools for the analysis of  dynamical processes involved in brain functioning. Despite their huge  complexity, brain functions are indeed based on elementary dynamics,  some of which can be apprehended by a mathematical approach.  Mastering these techniques is fundamental to progress in our  understanding of brain functioning, to optimize instrumentation for brain  activity measurements (brain imaging, electrophysiological recordings…),  to improve brain-machine interfaces, to build up neuro-inspired  computational units, and to understand the mechanisms involved in some  brain diseases and thus improve their treatment.           Quarter number  SG6     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)   - SG1 : Information systems and programming   - SG1-ST2-SG3 : Convergence, integration, probability, partial differential  equations  - ST2 : Modelling  - ST4 : Signal processing  - ST5 : Control theory         Syllabus    Chapter 1: Fundamentals in physiology and brain functions (CM: 6h)   This first chapter introduces the physiological bases of neuronal  activity. It describes the elementary principles involved in the  generation of an action potential and in the communication between   63      neurons (soma, axon, dendrite, synapse, ion channels, rest potential),  as well as synaptic plasticity and homeostatic regulation mechanisms.  It describes the physical and biological principles that come into play in  these behaviors. It finally presents the main brain functions (memory,  motor tasks, olfaction, and vision) and their alteration in pathological  conditions.    Chapter 2: Measurement and actuation of brain activity (CM: 3h)  This second chapter presents different techniques to measure brain  activity, including electrophysiological techniques (patch-clamp, multiunit recordings, LFP, EEG, MEG) and brain imaging (MRI, 2-photon). It  also describes technological ways to influence brain activity, including  electrical stimulation and optogenetics.    Chapter 3: Brain-machine interfaces (CM: 4.5h)  This sixth chapter addresses the development of brain-machine  interfaces, also known as neuroprostheses. These devices aim at  restoring the autonomy of amputated or quadriplegic patients. Their  implementation in animals or humans also provides knowledge on the  functioning and learning of natural sensory-motor loops. This chapter  details the needed elements for such interfaces: neuronal activity  recording (whether invasive or not), signal processing, motor control,  and sensory feedback from the prosthesis to the brain. It also  describes the plasticity mechanisms on which these interfaces can rely  to optimize learning.    Chapter 4: Mathematical models of neurons (CM: 3h)  This chapter presents well-known neuron models. It introduces  conductance-based models through the famous Hodgkin-Huxley model  and underlines its electronic analogy. It then presents simplified  models, such as integrate & fire or FitzHug-Nagumo models, as well as  simple models of synapses and neuronal plasticity. Numerical  simulation of these models is also introduced.    Chapter 5: Analysis of neuron models (CM: 6h, TP: 3h)  This chapter present mathematical tools to study neuronal behavior. It  introduces the notion of phase diagram and bifurcation. These notions  are first given for one-dimensional systems, and then for planar  systems. The chapter establishes a link between these bifurcations and  the qualitative behavior of the neuron. A lab session on MatlabSimulink aims at implementing a conductance-based model of a  neuron and to predict its response thanks to the introduced  theoretical tools.    Chapter 6: Neuronal populations (CM: 3h, TP: 3h)  This chapter addresses the dynamics of a whole population of neurons  or a cerebral structure. It presents simplified models of the activity of a   64         population, such as the Wilson-Cowan model or neural fields. It shows  how to predict the behavior of such models by stability or bifurcation  analysis. A lab session on Matlab-Simulink will aim at studying the  binocular rivalry phenomenon through a simple neuronal population  model.   Conference: Example of a start-up creation (1.5h)  A conference by the co-funder and scientific manager of start-up  Dreem (Rhythm) concludes this course by presenting recent industrial  innovations (non-invasive measurement of brain activity, pattern  recognition in electrophysiological data, …) as well as opportunities  given by neuroscience for industry and entrepreneurship.          Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)  CM, TD, TP, homework.     Grading  Evaluation will be made based on a written exam without documents (2h)  at the end of the course and on the written reports of the two lab sessions.  The following weights are envisioned: 60% for the written exam and 20%  for each lab session report. Any unjustified absence at the TP will lead to a  zero as TP grade. Skills will be evaluated through the lab session reports  and the written exam.  Skills C1.2 and C1.3 will be deepened during the lab  sessions.

They will  know of mathematical tools to model activity of a single neuron or a whole  neuronal population, and to predict their dynamical properties both  analytically and through simulations. They will also have been made aware  of opportunities offered by neuroscience in terms of research, medical and  industrial development, and entrepreneurship.     Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course   By the end of this course, students will be able to:    •  Understand neuroscience fundamentals, for possible interaction with   professionals of the field (neurosurgeons, computational  neuroscientists, experimenters)   •  Model the activity of a neuron or a whole neuronal population  •  Predict their behavior both analytically and numerically.
