   2EL1710 - Advanced probabilities       Instructors: Erick Herbin  Department: DÉPARTEMENT MATHÉMATIQUES  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Fundamental Sciences  Advanced level : Yes      Description  This theoretical course is a follow-up to the 1st year Mathematics course,  which  includes  the  basic  concepts  of  probability  theory.  It  introduces  the  foundations  of  the  general  theory  of  stochastic  processes,  taking  into  account the temporal evolution of random concepts.     These  probabilistic  models  constitute  the  basic  mathematical  objects  for  modelling phenomena with high variability, uncertainty or complexity that  make  it  impossible  to  describe  them  in  detail.  Among  them,  Brownian  motion is widely used to describe phenomena (natural, physical, biological  or financial) based on stochastic differential equations. It is at the crossroads  of  important  classes  such  as  martingales,  Markov  processes  or  Gaussian  processes, from which it inherits properties.     The objective of this course is the theoretical study of the first two families  of stochastic processes, in the particular case where the parameters are in a  discrete space, and then to introduce Gaussian processes indexed by the real  ones. The course is in the classic format of a mathematics course in which  the fundamental theorems are demonstrated on the board.
