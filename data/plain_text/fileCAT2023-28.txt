   2EL1440 - Modeling and numerical simulation of   reactive media       Instructors: Benoît Fiorina  Department: DÉPARTEMENT MÉCANIQUE ENERGÉTIQUE PROCÉDÉS  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Engineering Sciences  Advanced level : No      Description    Reactive media cover a vast field of studies that fit perfectly into the  current energy and environmental context. From a scientific point of view,  reactive media include combustion and plasmas. From one side,  combustion accounts for 80% of primary energy conversion, and is present  in the energy, transport and process sectors. On the other side, plasmas  represent more than 99% of the visible matter in the universe. Plasma are  used in a wide range of industrial applications: energy, semiconductor  manufacturing, transformation and treatment processes, and health.   The aim of this course is to introduce fundamentals of combustion and  plasmas. It focuses on the importance of numerical modelling, which is a  key element of research and development strategies in reactive systems  engineering.  To illustrate the field of application of reactive media in the  field of energy, students will build a multi-physics numerical tool to  simulate an emerging and promising technology based on plasma-assisted  combustion of a hydrogen turbine.

Learning outcomes covered on the course    To dimension reactive systems, an engineer has to make approximations  and calculate orders of magnitude. He has to calculate mass, chemical  species and energy balances. He must determine the thermochemical  equilibrium of a reactive system and know how to exploit thermochemical  imbalances. In particular, this course provides the following skills:    - Understand the industrial, energy and environmental stakes of  combustion and plasmas.  - Be able to establish the fundamental equations for dimensioning  combustion and plasma systems  - Characterize the thermodynamic and chemical transient and equilibrium  states of a reactive system    Partially Ionized Gases, M.

The code developed by  the student will be based on a MATLAB library of pre-existing  thermochemical functions.        Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course     To design reactive systems, engineers must make approximations and  calculate orders of magnitude. They must carry out mass, chemical and  energy balances. They must determine the thermo-chemical equilibrium of  a reactive system and know how to exploit thermo-chemical imbalances.  This course provides for that purpose the following skills:  - Understand the industrial, energy and environmental challenges of  combustion and plasmas  - Establish the fundamental equations for designing combustion and  plasma systems  - Characterize the thermochemical transient and equilibrium states of a  reactive system  - Program (under Matlab environment) a numerical tool for chemical  reactors with detailed kinetics.
