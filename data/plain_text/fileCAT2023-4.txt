   2CC3000 - Optimization       Instructors: Jean-Christophe Pesquet  Department: DÉPARTEMENT MATHÉMATIQUES  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS, ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE METZ, CAMPUS DE RENNES, CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 36,00          Description    This course will explore various fundamental notions of both continuous  and discrete optimization.    The following topics will be addressed and implemented: formulation of  optimization problems, existence conditions for global and local  minimizers, convexity, duality, Lagrange multipliers, first-order methods,  linear programming, integer linear programming, branch and bound  approaches, preliminary stochastic optimization concepts.        Quarter number  ST7     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)    Basics in functional analysis, differential calculus, and probability  (convergence, integration and probability course), knowledge of a  programming environment        Syllabus  1. Optimization basics    1.1 Introductory notions  1.2 Existence of minimizers  1.3 Convexity  1.4 Duality   2. Linear programming    3. Integer linear programming   27        4. More advanced notions in continuous optimization    4.1 Lagrange multipliers method  4.2 Some iterative algorithms   5. Stochastic Optimization     Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)  This course combines lectures and exercise/practical classes.   This represents 22,5 hours of lectures, 10.5 of exercise classes, and 1.5  hour of final exam.       Grading  The grading will be based on a continuous evaluation process and the final  written exam. In case of a justified absence to intermediary examinations,  the grades of the latters are replaced by the grade of the final examination.     Course support, bibliography    D. P.

Learning outcomes covered on the course  Upon completion of this course, the students will be able to :   address a wide range of concrete optimization problems arising either in a  scientific or industrial context.   Formulate the problem in a suitable manner, to handle it numerically by  using existing methods,   validate and interpret the solution with regards to the initial problem.
