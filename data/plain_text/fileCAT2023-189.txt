         ST7 - 79 - DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY AT THE SERVICE    OF THE HUMAN FACTOR     Dominante :  Info&Num  (Computer  Science  &  Digital),  MDS  (Mathematics,  Data  Sciences), VSE (Living-Health, Environment)  Langue d’enseignement : English  Campus où le cours est proposé : Rennes        Engineering problem   The massive recourse to computer automation of numerous processes, to  AI-type decision-making agents, and to the analysis of ever larger data sets,  question the relationship between humans and information technologies.    In  fact,  the  current  speed  of  development  of  these  technologies,  and  the  wealth of tools that are emerging, allow us to get even closer to the human  being. Analysis  of expressions  and emotions  by extraction  of  multi-sensor  data (webcam, kinect, micro, EEG, sweating), modeling of human behavior  in  critical  contexts  (crisis,  health  problems,  depression)  and  advanced  analysis of interactions between different agents, are all possibilities offered  by digital tools.   For research in the humanities and medicine, these new methods represent  an opportunity to refine our understanding of subjects, patients and their  relationship  to  the  world  or  to  others  (autistic  behavior,  collaborative  contexts).   The CentraleSupélec engineer will be able to understand how to put digital  technology  at  the  service  of  the  human  factor,  what  its  possibilities  and  limits are, and which technologies are appropriate for building the computer  science of tomorrow.   Advised prerequisites   Courses  in  Algorithms  and  Complexity,  Statistics  and  Learning,  Signal  Processing   Context and issue modules: These modules include an introductory lecture  on the theme, presentations on the technological and scientific challenges,  and  a  presentation  of  the  associated  projects.  The  whole  will  allow  to  highlight a common problem (the analysis of non-verbal behavior) with very   585         varied application fields, and will give an introduction to social psychology,  on the aspects of verbal and non-verbal language.   Specific course (60 HEE) : 2D-3D Image and Sound Analysis   Brief description: the course will cover three important parts necessary for  project completion:   Image analysis:   feature detection  Sound  analysis  :  time-frequency  representation,  speech  modeling,  spatial  audio   segmentation,    Filtering,    Project:  What  you  say  without  meaning  to:  deciphering  and  automatic  analysis of non-verbal behavior                     - Associated partner :    - Location: Rennes   -  Brief  description:  Every  year,  the  audio,  video  and  machine  learning  communities  gather  around  international  research  challenges  on  the  automatic  analysis  of  human  behaviors:  emotions,  depression,  mood,  motion  detection,  etc.  (e.g.  http://sspnet.eu/avec2017/).  The  project  consists in the participation to one of these challenges. It is about, from a  large  corpus  of  data  representing  subjects  in  action,  to  automatically  determine information about their behavior and emotions.   Each  project  team  will  focus  on  a  particular  study  (e.g.  voice,  face,  etc.),  knowing  that  all  the  teams  will  participate  in  the  same  international  challenge.    It will therefore be necessary to choose and apply certain methods seen in  the course of image and 3D sound analysis. The classification and regression  tools  will  lead  to  the  implementation  of  optimization  algorithms  (neural  network regression, fuzzy logic, SVM,...).      586
