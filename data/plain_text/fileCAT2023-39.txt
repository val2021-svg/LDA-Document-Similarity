   2EL1750 - Advanced statistics       Instructors: Sarah Lemler  Department: DÉPARTEMENT MATHÉMATIQUES  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Fundamental Sciences  Advanced level : Yes        Description   The Advanced Statistics course aims to present various statistical methods  for the estimation, the prediction and for determining the properties of the  proposed estimators. We will develop two themes:   •  multivariate linear regression  •  non-parametric statistics   The course covers both the theoretical aspects of these concepts but also  proposes a practical application of the models and methods considered  using TPs with R software on data sets from different domains.     To be downloaded before the first TP:   •  the R software https://www.r-project.org/  •  the RStudio interface https://www.rstudio.com/      Quarter number  SG8     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)     For this course the prerequisites are as follows:     You must be familiar with the concepts seen in Statistics and Learning in  1st year, in particular:   •  estimators,   •  confidence intervals,   •  the tests,   •  the first notions on the linear model    134       Syllabus   We will develop two themes:   •  multivariate linear regression,   •  non-parametric statistics.      Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)  The course will be done on the board (for the most theoretical part) or  from projected slides when it will be necessary, for example, to present an  application made from the R software.    There are 35 hours scheduled for this course, including 2 hours for the final  exam, about 15 hours of TP/TD (can be modulated) and 18 hours of  classes.        Grading  The course consists of two evaluations: a homework assignment (DM) to  be written in pairs to be returned halfway through the course (the date will  be specified during the first class) a 2-hour final exam (EX) covering the  entire course. The score of this course will then be the average of the  scores of the two previous evaluations ((1/3)*DM+(2/3)*EX) rounded to  the nearest half point. Failing students can re-take the exam in a second  session EX2 in the same way as the first session exam EX. The course's  score after the second session is the one of the exam EX2 (without the  DM).     Course support, bibliography  The 1st year course material of Statistics and learning written by PaulHenry Cournède      Resources  At the end of each course, TDs or TPs exercises will be proposed to  familiarize themselves with the theoretical concepts seen in class and put  them into practice to answer concrete problems, possibly based on data  sets.      Learning outcomes covered on the course    •  Use of parametric and non-parametric statistical estimation   techniques   •  Validate a model and understand the limits of a statistical model  •  Propose, implement and calibrate a predictive model  •  Use the R software and interpret results    135           Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course    •  Use of parametric and non-parametric statistical estimation   techniques   •  Validate a model and understand the limits of a statistical model  •  Propose, implement and calibrate a predictive model  •  Use the R software and interpret results    136
