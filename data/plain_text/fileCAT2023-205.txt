Quarter number  Intensive week SG6     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  Good knowledge of the basics of Python 3.     Syllabus  The course is divided into 5 major parts.    I. Introduction to the blockchain and cryptographic elements  - The shared ledger  - Block chaining  - One-way function    II. Implementation of the blockchain  - Proof of work  - Nodes and miners  - Composition of a transaction  - Initialization of a chain  - Composition of a block  - Validation process    III. Advanced concepts  - Mining  - Crypto risk  - Other proofs   630      - Smart Contract  - Consensus  - Fork of the chain and resolution    IV. issues  - Pool and governance  - Vulnerabilities  - Ethics and legal    V. TP  - Implementation of a simple blockchain in Python  - Proposal of an application integrating it     Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)  - Lectures: 6x3h  - TP: 3x3h     Grading  Validation on the TP and a report.      Resources  - Lectures  - Practical Work  - Reading of support and synthesis    The courses and supervision of TP are provided by Marc-Antoine Weisser.     Learning outcomes covered on the course  At the end of this course, the student will be able to understand how works  a shared ledger using blockchain technology, to know its possibilities, its  issues and its limitations. The student will have acquired:  - basic elements of asymmetric cryptography (one-way function, hashing,  public key and private key, etc.);  - the fundamental elements of blockchain technology (block chaining,  proof of work, nodes, mining, composition of a block, etc.);  - some extensions and alternatives (proof of stake, smart contract,  consensus, ...);   - the stakes (security, governance, vulnerability, ...).    Learning outcomes:  - Know the principles of asymmetric cryptography   - Understand how blockchains work   - Implement a blockchain    631      - Distinguish the relevant use cases of a blockchain   - Design an application implementing a blockchain        Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course  C1.1: Examine problems in their entirety and beyond their immediate  parameters. Identify, formulate and analyse the scientific, economic and  human dimensions of a problem   C1.4 : Design, detail and corroborate a whole or part of a complex system.     632
