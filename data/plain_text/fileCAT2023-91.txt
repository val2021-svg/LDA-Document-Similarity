   2EL6030 - Operating systems       Instructors: Frederic Tronel  Department: CAMPUS DE RENNES  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE RENNES  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Fundamental Sciences  Advanced level : Yes      Description  This teaching is part of the infosec course. The objective of this course is to  give all knowledges required to realise a real kernel that is able to manage  the process memory, the interruptions (and consequently the system calls),  and is able to perform basic inputs-outputs.     Quarter number  SG8     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)   The prerequisites for this lecture are the following ones:  - Fluency in C language (e.g. by following the compilation course).  - Knowledge of RISC-V assembly language (e.g. by following the computer  architecture course) would be a plus.         Syllabus   The course is organised as follows:   I Lesson 1:   II Lesson 2 :   - Operating system history   - Operating system startup  - Control registers  - Priviledge levels  - Interrupt management  - System calls   III Lesson 3 :   - Process scheduling   - Scheduling algorithms  - Context switching    IV Lesson 4 :   - Synchronization primitives in kernel and user spaces   292      - Concurrency problems  - Pseudo-concurrency and real concurrency   V Lesson 5 :   - Virtual memory management  - Segmentation vs pagination  - Memory protection  - Binary loading  - Memory allocation algorithms        Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)   Lectures: 15h  Labs: 18h       Grading  Final exam: oral exam  Mandatory evaluations: Reports for two labs, including the code produced  to answer the questions, and the number of functional tests passed by the  code.    NF=0.5 CF + 0.5 EO  Skill C2.1 is validated at milestone 2 by the validation of this course.  Skill C6.2 is validated at milestone 2 after having validated the practical  exercises (having the average on the 2 practical exercises)  Skill C7.1 is validated at milestone 2 on the performance during the oral  presentation.
