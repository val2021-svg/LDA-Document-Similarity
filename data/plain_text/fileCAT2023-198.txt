   2SC8110 - Multiphysical couplings for additive   manufacturing       Instructors: Camille Gandiolle, Andrea Barbarulo  Department: DÉPARTEMENT MÉCANIQUE ENERGÉTIQUE PROCÉDÉS  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 34,50          Description  This course will cover in a broad sense the concepts and challenges of  multiphysical coupling.       Quarter number  ST7     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  To have completed the "continuum mechanic" SSI course and at least one  of the following courses: Materials, Transport phenomena,  Thermodynamics.     Syllabus   This course will cover in a broad sense the concepts and challenges of  multiphysical coupling.  The following topics will be adressed:    •  Strong - weak coupling;  •  Coupling of different formulations;  •  Coupling of different scales.   Then particular coupling, of interest for additive manufacturing will be  studied in more details:    •  Laser on powder: electro-thermal coupling  •  Powder bed melting: discrete-continuous coupling, solid-fluid   coupling and thermo-mechanical coupling   •  Cooling phase: aerothermal-mechanical coupling   612      The course will end with a reflection on the mechanical behavior of the  final part (influence of residual stress, porosity, microstructure...)         Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)  8 lessons of 1h30 and 14 tutorials and case study sessions of 1h30.     Grading   The knowledge will be tested by a MCQ (multiple-choice questionnaire)  (=N1) and the skills acquired will be tested by a case study in groups of 3  consisting in implementing a coupled system both analytically and by finite  element modeling on comsol (N2=80%group result + 20%individual note).
