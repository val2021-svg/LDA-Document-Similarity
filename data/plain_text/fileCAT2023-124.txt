   2SC5510 - Physics of matter       Instructors: Hichem Dammak  Department: DÉPARTEMENT PHYSIQUE  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 34,50          Description  The course aims to provide students with the basic knowledge of solidstate physics. Using specific examples from advanced sectors, such as  nanosciences or optoelectronics, the goal is:  - to introduce them to this vast and rich physics field,  - give them the tools that will allow them to confront with confidence the  many challenges that this field will bring to tomorrow's applications.

Paillard     Learning outcomes covered on the course   At the end of the course, students are expected to know:  1) Determine the crystal system and Bravais lattice of a crystal and specify  the lattice multiplicity chosen from a geometric data of a lattice of atoms.  2) Express the inter-reticular distances using Miller indices.  3) Apply Bragg's law to analyze the results of a diffraction experiment using  X-rays, neutrons or electrons.  4) Identify, among the phonon dispersion relation curves along a direction  of the reciprocal lattice, the optical, longitudinal acoustic and transverse  acoustic branches as well as its degeneracy.  5) Determine the density of phonon states in the Debye model in 1D, 2D or  3D.  6) Calculate the contribution of phonons to the specific heat using the  Debye model.  7) Apply the free electron model to determine the electronic states in a  quantum well in 1D or 2D.  8) Apply the free electron model to calculate the density of electronic  states and the Fermi energy.   405      9) Apply the free electron model to determine the contribution of  electrons to the specific heat.  10) Identify, from the electron energy dispersion relations, the metallic,  insulating or semiconducting character of a crystal.  11) Determine the carrier density in an intrinsic or doped semiconductor  from a model of the valence and conduction band electron density curves.  12) Describe the equilibrium of a P-N junction (diode).
