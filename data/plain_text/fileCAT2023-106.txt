   2EL6210 - Geopolitics of resources and objects       Instructors: Raphael Danino-Perraud  Department: CAMPUS DE RENNES  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE RENNES  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Business Sciences  Advanced level : No      Description       In their future careers as engineers, CentraleSupélec students will be called  upon  to  place  their  practices  in  globalized  economic  and  political  worlds.  These  are  characterized  by  the  interconnection  of  different  parts  of  the  globe and an intensification of the flow of capital, goods and services on a  global  scale,  made possible  in particular by the development of  means of  transportation and information and communication technologies. Although  globalized  production  and  exchange  networks  appear  to  be  free  of  all  material  constraints,  they  remain  highly  dependent  on  natural  resources  and technical objects.    Since  the  end  of  the  20th  century,  human  activities  and  their  impacts  (urbanization,  climatic  and  environmental  changes)  have  contributed  to  increasing the pressure on resources and their availability. The geopolitics of  resources  and  objects  influences  international  power  relations  and  raises  power issues at various scales (local, national, regional, global).    To understand the stakes of our globalized political and economic system,  we must therefore adopt a critical reading of techniques and resources. To  do so, we adopt a perspective centered on a certain number of resources  (mining,  agricultural  and  energy,  but  also  waste)  and  infrastructures  (pipeline, electrical network, hydroelectric dam). It is from these geopolitical  themes that students will be led to identify the power relationships between  actors and the economic stakes associated with them.     Quarter number  SG6     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)     None   344           Syllabus  Detailed course outline (content): 11 sessions of 3h, 1 exam of 1h30  Session 1 - Introduction: a brief epistemology of resources - Raphaël  Danino-Perraud and Angélique Palle (TD)  Session 2 - A transnational energy transport infrastructure as a geopolitical  object - Noémie Rebière (CM)  Session 3 - Methodology of geopolitical mapping - Léa Gobin and Noémie  Rebière (lab)  Session 4 - Geopolitical impacts induced by the energy transition: risks on  objects and resources circulation - Angélique Palle (CM)  Session 5 - Project support - Raphael Danino-Perraud and David Juilien (PT)  Session 6 - Applied exercise: role-playing - Wahel Rashid and David Juilien  (PT)  Session 7 - Producing and feeding ourselves: conflicts over resources -  Matthieu Brun (CM)  Session 8 - Hydroelectric dams, a geopolitical object - David Juilien and  Wahel Rashid (TD)  Session 9 - Mineral raw materials, globalized resources: the example of  lithium - Audrey Sérandour (CM)  Session 10 - Waste, a geopolitical object - Wahel Rashid and Raphaël  Danino-Perraud (TD)  Session 11 - The contrasting application of the duty of care for resources  and conclusion of the course - Raphaël Danino-Perraud (CM)  Session 12 - Homework (1h30)         Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)         Grading    Student learning will be assessed in two ways:     1.          A cartographic analysis file, carried out in groups (of 3-4  students) equivalent to 50% of the grade.  Throughout the sequence, students will have to build a geopolitical  reflection around a resource or a globalized object. They will have to  identify the main actors and issues raised by this resource or object,  take a critical look at the materiality of the resources and techniques  studied (no technology is neutral) and construct a reflection at different  scales (global, regional, national, local).  Based on a bibliographic research, students will have to produce two  analytical maps presenting a geopolitical reasoning around a globalized  resource or object. At least one of the two maps must be produced on a   345      global scale. The supervision of this work will begin during the session  on the methodology of geopolitical cartography (session 3), then we will  have a session dedicated to the accompaniment of projects (session 5).  The restitution will take the form of a written file, including the two  maps, a description of the problematized legend (in 1 page) and an  analysis of the maps (in 5 pages maximum). This written report will be  graded.  Follow-up on the project will be organized during the semester through  presentations on the state of the art (not graded).     2.          A table-top assignment, carried out in session 12 (duration:  1h30) equivalent to 50% of the grade.   This will consist of a commentary on documents (a corpus composed of  excerpts from articles, a map and a graph). The corpus will present a  case study, which will be analyzed by mobilizing the concepts studied in  class.

He will be able to  identify the relevant actors and detect the power relations crystallized  around a resource or an object, at various scales;  - read a map and understand it from a geopolitical and critical perspective.  They will also have acquired the basics of freehand cartography.       Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course     analyze: study a system as a whole, the situation as a whole. Identify,  formulate and analyze a system within the framework of a transdisciplinary  approach with its scientific, economic, human dimensions, etc.  C2.2: Import knowledge from other fields or disciplines  C5.3 : Analyze global and/or local issues at the international level and  adapt projects or solutions to them        347         348
