   2SC5893 - Intelligent system for automated control of   air traffic       Instructors: Lina Ye  Department: DOMINANTE - INFORMATIQUE ET NUMÉRIQUE  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 40  On-site hours (HPE): 27,00            Description  Safety-critical  systems  in  the  avionics  field  are  subject  to  strict  time  and  reliability  constraints.  Their  development  therefore  requires  engineering  techniques that take these characteristics into account as early as possible  in their life cycle. This EI is therefore interested in the design of models of  intelligent  systems  to  control  air  traffic  and  the  verification  of  important  safety  properties.  These  systems  are  composed  of  highly  interacting  components  that  are  parallel  and  synchronous.  All  these  subsystems  are  subject to verification to ensure their own functionality. For example, it is  essential  to  demonstrate  the  absence  of  deadlock  and  the  possibility  for  each  to  ensure  correct  operations  compatible  with  their  own  time  constraints.     Quarter number  ST5     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)    ST5: Industrial complex and critical systems with preponderant software     Syllabus    Based on the informal description of the safety-critical system, the students  are asked to use a semi-formal modelling approach to capture and structure  safety requirements and then to transform into a formal model (e.g., timed  automata)  before  applying  model-checking  techniques  for  the  formal  verification  purposes. An  optional  part  is  dedicated  to  develop  a  tool  to  detect a type of unrealistic scenarios in models, which can very often disturb  the results of model checkers like UPPAAL.    453        Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)  One-week project integrating ST5 course content with demonstrative,  active and discovery methods.

Resources  WIFI, PROJECTOR  UPPAAL     Learning outcomes covered on the course  Students need to know and understand how to design a safety system with  informal and formal approaches by ensuring safety requirements.     Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course  Students must be able to exploit their resources (e.g. their own  knowledge), master the work environment, achieve goals by producing  results and also develop self-help and sharing with others in the group.  454
