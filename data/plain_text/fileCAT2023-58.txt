On the one hand, many companies find it difficult to innovate,  because  their  organisation,  which  is  the  basis  of  their  successful  business  model, is also a brake on innovation, which is why Innovation Departments  have been created alongside R&D, Marketing and Strategy Departments. On  the other hand, even more start-ups are exploring and experimenting with  new business models, in order to find out what is valuable for the customer,  how to deliver this value, and how to make money while doing so.
