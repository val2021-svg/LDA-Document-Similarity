   2SC7910 - 2D-3D image and sound analysis       Instructors: Catherine Soladie  Department: CAMPUS DE RENNES  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE RENNES  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 34,50        Description   Sight, hearing, touch, smell and taste. It is through our 5 senses that we  apprehend our environment and interact with it. In recent years, living  beings are no longer the only ones who interact and understand the world  around them. More and more powerful automatic image and sound  analysis tools are created every day. Whether for autonomous driving,  space, medical, the fields of application are multiple. And more recently,  these techniques have gained new momentum with Deep Learning and  generative models. It is now difficult to recognize a true picture of a  fake picture  And it becomes easy to make artificially but effectively say  whatever you want to whoever you want.  In this module, you will discover an overview of analysis and synthesis  techniques for 2D and 3D image and sound, through precise use cases. You  will be the actors of the understanding and the artificial modification of  your environment!     Quarter number  ST7    Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)   Statistics et machine learning.
