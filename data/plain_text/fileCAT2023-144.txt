   2SC5990 - Design of a motorised wheelchair for people   with reduced mobility       Instructors: Jean-Louis Gutzwiller  Department: DOMINANTE - VIVANT, SANTÃ‰, ENVIRONNEMENT, DOMINANTE -  ENERGIE  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE METZ  Workload (HEE): 40  On-site hours (HPE): 27,00          Description    This integration teaching, which is part of the thematic sequence "Assistance  and autonomy of the person", deals with the concepts of how to operate an  electric  wheelchair  for  a  paralyzed  person.  Such  a  chair  has  a  joystick  for  controlling motors that actuate the wheels. The function of the chair must  be as accurate and as fast as possible to respond to the users inputs. The  mechanics,  the  electronics  and  the  algorithms  used  for  the  control  participate together to obtain the desired performances.     Quarter number  ST5     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  Control of a motorization chain     Syllabus  Different topics will be proposed as:  - study and design of an electronic control board for electrical motors,  - study and design of the computer program to put in the microprocessor,  - study and design of connectivity with other objects (smartphone,  internet),  - simulation of the mechanical behavior of the system in order to optimize  the control ...     Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)  The students will choose, in groups of 3 to 5, one of the proposed topics.  These topics will be dealt with during the project time (from Monday to  Thursday) and an evaluation will be done on the last day (Friday).    461        Grading  Students will be required to provide a written report by group and will have  to support their work with an oral presentation. The mark of the report will  be 50% in the final mark for all the members of the group and the individual  mark obtained at the oral presentation will also be 50% of the final mark.      Resources  Teaching  will  be  in  the  form  of  a  project  during  which  students  will  have  access  to  computer,  electronic  and  mechanical  equipment  (depending  on  the subject of the project).     Learning outcomes covered on the course  At the end of this course, students will be able to:  - design a part of a motor control chain (depending on the chosen subject),  - pilot the realization of the device (give the manufacturer clear  instructions for the realization of the device),  - write and test the computer programs necessary for the operation of the  device.     Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course   C4 : Have a sense of value creation for his company and his customers  C6 : Be operational, responsible, and innovative in the digital world  C7 : Know how to convince        462
