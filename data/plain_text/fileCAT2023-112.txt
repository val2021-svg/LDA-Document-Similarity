   ST5 - 52 - CONTROL OF BIOPROCESSES FOR  ENVIRONMENT AND BIOMANUFACTURING     Dominante : VSE (Living-Health-Environment) and GSI (Large Interacting Systems)  Langue d’enseignement : French  Campus où le cours est proposé : Paris-Saclay        Engineering problem  Sustainable  development  is  playing  an  increasingly  important  role  in  the  current and future development of various industrial sectors. Solutions for  modernizing and evolving the means of production are being developed in  order to limit greenhouse gas emissions, in particular by offering alternatives  to  fossil  fuels.  Among  the  solutions  studied,  this  sequence  topic  is  more  specifically  in  bioprocesses,  efficient  and  sustainable,  as  alternative to current production technologies.    interested   Bioprocesses  use  living  systems  or  their  components  for  producing  goods  services. Their emergence requires the implementation of multidisciplinary  knowledge,  in  particular  for  the  optimization  of  their  functioning  (maximization of productivity and/or degradation of pollutants).   This  teaching  offers  scientific  tools  for  the  development  of  bioprocesses  through the design of automatic systems related to:    •  Energy (e.g. production of biofuels),  •  Production  of  high  value-added  molecules  (e.g.  production  of   cosmetics, medicines),   •  Pollution treatment (e.g. wastewater treatment),  •  Greenhouse gas control (e.g. CO2 capture),  •  Reduction of the ecological footprint (e.g. production of biopolymers).   In  this  course,  the  concept  of  using  bioprocesses  for  sustainable  development is presented, as well as the design of automated systems to  maintain  the  bioprocess  in  optimal  operating  conditions  (to  maximize  its  productivity).  The  approach  can  be  extended  to  other  bioprocess  applications  not  covered  here  in  the  biotechnology  sector  (e.g.  stem  cell  culture  for  medical  applications).  The  concepts  presented  can  also  be  applied  to  broader  sectors  such  as  pharmaceutical,  genetic  engineering,  cosmetics, agri-food, etc. The intervention of industrialists in the field allows  a  better  understanding  of  the  issues  associated  with  the  use  and  optimization  of  bioprocesses  for  sustainable  development.  within  the  framework of sustainable development.   365      In this course, bioprocess sizing is addressed as well as automated systems  design  to  maintain  the  bioprocess  under  optimal  operating  conditions  in  order to maximize its productivity.

Adviced prerequisites   No prerequisite required   Context and stakes module   This module is organized around half-days aimed at presenting the teaching,  the challenge week and introducing the issues associated with bioprocesse  and sustainable development. The following presentations are proposed:   -  Conference "History and perspectives of biotechnology development" giving  an overview of the evolution of biotechnology and the current and future  needs of this sector.   -  Conference on sustainable development.  -  Conference  on  the  energy  transition  providing  an  overview  of  energy  sources (fossil, nuclear, renewable) and highlighting the interest and role of  bioprocesses  in  the  production  and  storage  of  energy,  as  well  as  the  associated challenges.   -  Conference  on  the  environmental  transition,  taking  stock  of  the  environmental  issues  that  need  to  be  addressed  (scarcity  of  resources,  pollution,  health  risks,  etc.)  and  highlighting  the  interest  and  role  of  bioprocesses in the recovery of waste and the conversion of biomass into  sustainable products.   -  Conference  on  the  contribution  of  bioprocesses  for  long  duration  space  missions  and  the  critical  importance  of  their  optimal  control.  These  bioprocesses  are  a  relevant  solution  for  nutritional  autonomy  and  for  recycling  water,  air  and  organic  matter  in  a  confined  environment.  Their  control is one of the keys to their reliability, which is absolutely necessary  given the needs they meet and the isolation of the space environment.   -  Conference on bioprocess control focusing more specifically on the role of  automation  in  the  design  and  optimization  of  bioprocess  for  resources  recovery.   -  Conference  on  bioethics,  showing  that  the  use  of  bioprocesses  raises  questions on the ethics of the proposed solutions, in particular when these  solutions call upon the design of organisms whose genome is modified. This   366      conference  is  an  introduction  to  the  issues  related  to  the  use  of  biotechnologies and, more generally, to the place of Man in the biosphere  and to the respect of nature and the environment.   Specific course (60 HEE)   Chemical  Engineering:  Chemical  Engineering:  application  to  environment  and biomanufacturing    Brief  description:  Modern  chemical  engineering  deals  with  designing,  operating,  and  optimizing  environmentally  friendly  processes  for  the  development of a variety of products and services in many traditional and  high-tech  sectors  (pharmaceuticals,  petroleum,  fine  chemicals,  food  processing,  treatment,  materials,  biotechnologies,  etc.),  and  for  the  production  of  traditional  (nuclear,  thermal, etc.) and renewable energies. Chemical engineering methodologies  are widely used to ensure the recycling and recovery of numerous products  and the purification of liquid and gaseous effluents, thus becoming tools of  choice in the strategy of sustainable development on a global scale.   cosmetics,  water   and  waste   The  challenges  associated  with  this  environmental  issue  are  numerous:  reducing  costs,  risks  and  dangers,  waste,  and  energy  and  raw  material  consumption.  Process  intensification  is  the  major  lever  for  taking  these  challenges up. This course is an introduction to chemical engineering and its  methodologies,  allowing  students  to  acquire  generalist  tools  that  can  be  easily  transposed  to  multiple  fields,  such  as  biotechnology  and  the  environment.  It  is  fully  in  line  with  the  environment,  energy  and  health  issues.  Most  of  the  case  studies  are  focused  on  bioprocesses  used  in  industrial biotechnology. The development of these bioprocesses is growing  rapidly  due  to  the  use of  living  organisms  to transform  matter  and  purify  polluted  systems,  and  the  employment  of  biomass  to  replace  fossil  resources.  The bioprocess is studied at the industrial bioreactor scale. The description  and understanding of biological processes (metabolism, maintenance, etc.)  at the cell level are not addressed. The biological agents are thus considered  as cellular catalysts transforming raw materials into products according to  known kinetic laws.     Challenge Week   The three integration courses cover the same learning objectives and have  a similar structure. The aim is to start from a performance specification for  a given bioprocess, to proceed to choices of bioprocess design and control  law  in  order  to  ensure  the  expected  performances  and  maximize  the  productivity of the designed system.   367      -  Associated partner: VEOLIA  -  -  Brief  description:   Location: Paris-Saclay campus   Challenge Week n°1: Optimized biological treatment of urban wastewater   In  urban  wastewater  treatment  plants,  biological  processes are designed to eliminate carbon and nitrogen pollution through  the  action  of  microorganisms  that  develop  spontaneously  in  aerobic  or  anaerobic environments.  The eliminated pollutants are concentrated in the form of aqueous biomass  suspensions or sludge, constituting voluminous waste with fermented target  and toxic materials. The treatment of sludge is therefore an important phase  of  wastewater  treatment  systems  that  must  ensure  the  reduction  of  its  volume  and  odor  nuisance.  One  of  the  most  common  processes  for  this  treatment  is  anaerobic  digestion,  which  produces  liquids  with  a  high  concentration  of  nitrogen  that  must  be  treated  again.  The  amount  of  nitrogen contained in these effluents can represent up to a 20% increase in  the nitrogen load to be eliminated by the plant. There are two solutions to  this  problem:  (1)  a  so-called  classical  one,  in  which  these  concentrated  effluents are directly returned to the head of the plant or (2) the anaerobic  ammonium oxidation process, or Anammox, an innovative alternative to the  traditional  nitrification/denitrification  processes,  allowing  the  direct  transformation of nitrite and ammonium into gaseous nitrogen.    In this challenge week, the objective is to propose control strategies for the  two  mentioned  solutions  in  order  to  meet  the  minimum  purification  requirements  of  the  treated  water  and  to  compare  their  performance  in  terms  of  operating  costs  and  biogas  production  as  a  vector  for  energy  recovery from sludge.   Challenge Week n°2: Life support system for space missions   - Associated partner: European Space Agency (ESA)   - Location: Paris-Saclay campus   - Brief description: ESA is developing a bioregenerative life support system  that allows astronauts to live autonomously, without refueling from Earth,  during long-duration space missions. This integration teaching concerns the  bioprocess  that  allows  regeneration  of  the  habitat  atmosphere.  It  is  a  photobioreactor  implementing  microalgae  that  consume  CO2,  produce  O2  and nutrient supplements.   In this week challenge, the objective is to model and size a photobioreactor  for 5 astronauts in total autonomy for 1000 days and to ensure the control  of  the  O2  production  via  the  transfer  of  light  for  reasonable  performance   368         criteria. These criteria are related to the reliability of operation, safety and  risks for the crew, the rate and efficiency of recycling, the activities required  for the crew, the energy consumption, the size and mass of the system.   Challenge Week n°3: Advanced supervision of biogas production from waste   - Associated partner: BioEnTech   - Location: Paris-Saclay campus   - Short description: Anaerobic digestion is a natural process of degradation  of organic matter by micro-organisms (bacteria and archaea) in the absence  of oxygen (anaerobic conditions). This process allows to recover a fraction  of  the  energy  contained  in  the  waste  in  the  form  of  biogas,  a  mixture  of  methane  and  CO2.  The  generalization  of  these  technologies  would  allow  considerable reduction of the energy demand necessary to treat the waste  (10% of the energy used on the planet) but could in the long term constitute  a source of energy. However, the anaerobic digestion process is complex and  involves  several  hundred  species  of  microorganisms.  Moreover,  it  is  unstable,  and  intermediate  compounds  (volatile  fatty  acids)  can,  under  certain  conditions,  accumulate  and  lead  to  the  total  shutdown  of  the  reactor. To avoid this type of accident, a very precise and costly monitoring  is necessary.    In this challenge week, the objective is to propose and develop supervision  and  control  strategies  to  reduce  the  risk  of  reactor  acidification  and  to  optimize the production of energy from the waste.   369
