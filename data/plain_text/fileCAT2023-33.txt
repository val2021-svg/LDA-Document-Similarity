   2EL1580 - Artificial Intelligence       Instructors: Fabrice Popineau  Department: DÉPARTEMENT INFORMATIQUE  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Fundamental Sciences  Advanced level : Yes      Description   What do web-based information retrieval, personal assistant development,  autonomous driving or automatic planning have in common?   These  are  all  complex  real-world  problems  that  artificial  intelligence  (AI)  aims to solve by addressing them with rigorous methods.   In  this  course,  you  will  study  the  fundamental  principles  that  guide  these  applications and implement some of these systems.   Specific  topics  include  automatic  learning,  state  space  search,  gaming,  Markov  decision  processes,  constraint  satisfaction,  graphic  models  and  logic.   The  main  objective  of  the  course  is  to  provide  you  with  a  framework  to  address new AI problems that you may encounter in the future.   The ethical and philosophical aspects of AI will also be discussed.         Quarter number  SG8     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  Information Systems and Programming Courses  Algorithmic and Complexity Course   Basics of probability: random variable, Bayes theorem       Syllabus    •  Introduction - Presentation of the domain  •  Agents and agent architectures  •    •  Machine learning and reflex agents   o  Linear predictors  o  Loss function and optimization   117      o  Neural networks   •  State representation and search   o Planners  o Adversarial search  o Utility functions  o Markov decision processes  o Reinforcement learning  •  Variable-based representation   o  Uncertain knowledge  o  Probabilistic reasoning  o  Bayesian Networks  o  Simple and complex decision making   •  Logic-based representation   o  Propositions and predicates  o  Syntax vs. semantics  o  Inference systems   •  Conclusion   o  Deeper on deep learning  o  Future of AI        Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)  The course scheduling includes about 18h of lectures and 15h of supervised  work.   The supervised work sessions are inserted every second class lecture.       Grading   The overall assessment will be based on:  - a continuous assessment grade on the programming projects (mandatory,  40% of the final grade)  - a 2-hour final exam with documents (60% of the final grade).

Learning outcomes covered on the course   By the end of this unit, students will be able to:  - identify the problems for which artificial intelligence techniques are  suitable and when it is the case to identify the appropriate techniques,  - formalize a given problem in the language/framework of different AI  techniques,  - implement elementary AI algorithms (e. g. state space search algorithms),  - design and implement an evaluation of different algorithms on a  formalization of a problem, and draw conclusions from this evaluation.       Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course  C6.4 Solve problems in a computational thinking process   C6.5 Use any type of data, structured or unstructured, including massive  data.    119
