   2SC8093 - Separation of sound sources from recordings   of several microphones       Instructors: Jean-Louis Gutzwiller  Department: DOMINANTE - MATHÃ‰MATIQUES, DATA SCIENCES  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE METZ  Workload (HEE): 80  On-site hours (HPE): 48,00            Description   This project, which is part of the thematic sequence 7 "Source separation  for optimal signal exploitation", focuses on the separation of multiple  sources in audio signals.    There are many concrete situations in which you want to capture a sound  so you can either record it for replay or amplify it live so that all  participants have a good perception.  In order to allow good intelligibility in the case of several speakers, a  microphone is usually placed in front of each speaker, or, in the theater, a  radio transmitter microphone is placed directly on the actors.  A significant improvement could be to use a fixed microphone array and to  have a processing algorithm to separate the sources, thus giving the  illusion of having an individual microphone per speaker or actor.       Quarter number  ST7     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  Probability 1A (CIP-EDP, 1SL1000),  Signal processing ST4 (1CC4000)  Statistics, Machine learning and Data processing ST4 (1CC5000),  Digital environment, computer and programming SG1 (1CC1000).     Syllabus  Evaluation of sound processing algorithms using matrix programming  language.  Computer development in C / C ++ language of the retained algorithms.    603        Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)     This teaching is in the form of a project.  For the duration of the project, students will be asked to keep a  "laboratory notebook", specifying in a few lines for each experiment or test  carried out, its motivations, the results obtained, the source codes and the  data used. During the last week dedicated to the project, students will be  asked to:  - provide the project report; and  - to carry out the defense in the presence of the partner.  A progress report of the project with reading of the "laboratory notebook"  and the draft report will take place regularly.       Grading    The project will be evaluated in two situations:    - in continuous assessment during the progress points and the reading of  the "laboratory notebook" and provisional report, with individual  evaluation of the contributions of each member (CC grade)  - during the final defense (grade S corresponding to the individual  presentation of each participant)    and by the quality of the deliverables (final report, commented source  codes, laboratory notebooks: grade QL).    The final grade = CC / 3 + S / 2 + QL / 6.    The evaluation of skills is specified in the paragraph "description of  acquired skills".      Resources     A network of microphones available in the smartroom of the Metz campus  makes it possible to make sound acquisitions. Students will work on  computers to develop the computer algorithm to achieve the desired  function.  80 HEE (48 HPE) of project.       Learning outcomes covered on the course    At the end of this course, students will be able to:  - Represent and decompose audio signals in an "optimal" way   604      - Adjusting a model to data  - Use a programming language to effectively write a signal processing  algorithm     Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course  C4 : Have a sense of value creation for his company and his customers  (evaluated during project monitoring)  C6 : Be operational, responsible, and innovative in the digital world  (evaluated throughout the project)   C7 : Know how to convince (evaluated during the follow-up, at the defense  and in the deliverables)  C8 : Lead a project, a team (evaluated by the laboratory notebooks)  605
