   2SC5592 - Quantum cascade lasers       Instructors: Thomas Antoni  Department: DOMINANTE - PHYSIQUE ET NANOTECHNOLOGIES  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 40  On-site hours (HPE): 27,00        Description  The aim of this course is to learn new concepts in modern maths and physics  and  to  realize  how  they  enable  technological  breakthroughs  that  can  be  industrialized.  This  course  is  also  a  first  opportunity  to  tackle  the  basic  principles  of  nanotechnologies.  In  addition  to  scientific  knowledge,  it  will  also develop the soft skills of the engineer job through teamwork, written  and oral communications.     Quantum  cascade  lasers  are  nanodevices  invented  twenty  years  ago.  Engineering  miracle  their  operation  is  possible  because  of  the  lattest  advances in quantum mechanics, optics and thermics. In a team work, the  students will get familiar with these concepts and implement an engineer  approach to turn them, numerically, in an object reality-constrained.       Quarter number    ST5     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)    Quantum and Statistical Physics , Partial Differentieal Equations      Syllabus    •  quantum physics (electronic transport, band structures,   semiconductors)   •  optics (mode guiding, cavities, emission)  •  lasers  •  basics of nanotechnologies  •  partial differential equations  •  numerical simulations through MATLAB or Python   410         Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)   This course is open to fourty students and will take place over a full week.   The students will be divided into two teams of twenty people, each team  having to deliver a numerical quantum laser. The teams will be composed  of four groups of five students, each group being more specifically  responsible for developing a basic unit of the device.     Grading   Group oral presentation (skills C1.2, C1.3, C4.1, C6.1, C7.2)  Personal report (skills C1.1, C1.4, C4.2, C7.1)  Quiz (skills C2.1, C2.2)  Personal contribution to the group (skills C2.3, C2.4, C2.5, C7.3, C7.4)     Course support, bibliography    A list of books available at the documentation center will be given dureing  the first session.     Resources   •   Exchanges with engineers who are experts in the various fields   covered   •   Bibliographic Resources  •   Use of MATLAB or Python      Learning outcomes covered on the course   •  turn a theoretical concept into an actual object  •  pose the problem  •  estimate orders of magnitude and iterate  •  criticize a result  •  know how to tackle multi-physics systems        Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course    •   Specify, design, build and validate all or part of a complex system  •   Mobilizing a broad scientific and technical base in the framework of   a transdisciplinary approach   •   Transpose to other disciplinary fields, generalize knowledge   411         •   Identify and rapidly acquire new knowledge and skills needed in   relevant technical, economic and other fields   •   Evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility and robustness of proposed   •   Choose solutions and act pragmatically, with a view to achieving   •   Making complex content intelligible.
