   2SC7310 - Circular economy   and industrial ecology methods       Instructors: Yann LEROY, François CLUZEL  Department: DÉPARTEMENT GÉNIE INDUSTRIEL ET OPÉRATIONS  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 34,50        Description  According  to  ADEME  (French  environmental  protection  agency),  Circular  Economy aims at shifting the current paradigm based on linear economy, by  limiting  the  waste  of  resources  and  environmental  impacts,  and  by  increasing the efficiency at all stages of products economy. It is composed  of 7 pillars: sustainable procurement, eco-design, industrial and territorial  ecology, functional economy, responsible consumption, longer duration of  use, recycling and waste recovery.    Industrial Ecology is an approach whose objective is to limit the impacts of  industry on the environment. It aims at considering an industrial system as  a whole to identify, model and optimize material and energy flows, as well  as  associated  environmental  impacts.  It  aims  at  reproducing  a  natural  system  in  the  human  activities,  where  all  material  and  energy  flows  are  reused,  where  the  notion  of  waste  does  not  exist  anymore.  All  economic  sectors are concerned.    The  course’s  objective  is  to  cover  the  different  dimensions  of  circular  economy  to  provide  to  the  students  a  global  vision  of  the  field.  Then  the  focus  will  be  made  on  the  operational  industrial  ecology  tools,  which  students will learn to manipulate (MFA (Material Flow Analysis, tool to map  material and energy flows) and LCA (Life-Cycle Assessment, tool to calculate  environmental impacts) software) to drive industrial ecology projects. These  tools will be directly used for the project of the engineering challenge term.

Introduction to Circular Economy and environmental impacts (Yann  Leroy and/or François Cluzel)    A. The Pillars of Circular Economy  The sessions 2-6 are built on the following format: lecture and  workshop on an industrial case study. These sessions go through the 7  pillars of Circular Economy according to the ADEME’s definition.  2. Product End-of-life (Yann Leroy and/or François Cluzel)  3. Ecodesign, extension of product lifespan and responsible  consumption (Yann Leroy and/or François Cluzel)  4. Sustainable procurement (Yann Leroy and/or François Cluzel)  5. Functional economy and responsible consumption (ATEMIS)  6. Industrial and Territorial Ecology (Yann Leroy and/or François Cluzel  and/or Andreas Hein)    B. Methods and tools for Industrial Ecology   The sessions 7-11 (Yann Leroy and/or François Cluzel) are dedicated to  Material Flow Analysis (MFA), Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and  Circularity and Sustainability Indicators (lectures and workshops).  These three approaches will be applied on a case study in group.    12. Final exam : duration 1h30        Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)  According to specific needs, the sessions will alternate lectures and  tutorials on industrial case (case study and or serious games), and tutorials  on MFA and LCA professional software (used during the project of the  Engineering Challenge Term). Some sessions may be organized as flipped  classrooms.     Grading  Final written exam on sessions 1 to 6 (50%) + evaluation of tutorials (per  group) for sessions 7-11 (50%)     Course support, bibliography   •  Adoue, C., 2007.
