These  populations  are  often  found  in  isolated  regions  in  rural  or  insular  areas. Thus, for 3/4 of them, it is not economically efficient to bring them  electricity by expanding the existing large electricity networks. Electrification  must  therefore  be  done  at  the  level,  through  microgrids.    The  generation  of  electricity  in  a  microgrid  can  be  done  using  fossil  fuels  (diesel  generators)  or  renewable  energies  (solar  panels...).  Thanks  to  technological  advances,  the  latter  are  generally  cheaper.  However,  their  intermittency  pushes  to  supplement  them  with  more  expensive  but  controllable  means  (diesel,  battery  storage...).  The  size  of  each  of  the  components of a microgrid (called its "sizing") must therefore be optimized  according  to  different  criteria:  the  economic  cost  of  course,  but  also  the  quality of service, energy independence or greenhouse gas emissions. The  management  of  energy  flows  (e.g.:  arbitrage between  diesel  and  battery)  also needs to be optimized. This project proposes to address these different  optimization challenges in the real case of an isolated island site.
