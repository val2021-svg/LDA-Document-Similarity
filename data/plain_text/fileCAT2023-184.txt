   2SC7710 - Numerical methods and problem solving for   optimizing embedded energy systems       Instructors: Maya Hage Hassan, Philippe Dessante  Department: DÉPARTEMENT SYSTÈMES D'ÉNERGIE ÉLECTRIQUE  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 34,50      Description  The  optimization  of  embedded  energy  systems  is  a  daily  problem  encountered in the industrial world (aeronautics, space or automotive). The  objectives  encountered  are  the  gain  in  volume,  cost  (optimal  design  or  operating  cost),  performance  or  efficiency.  The  system  and  multiphysics  aspect  of  the  design  is  now  taken  into  account  in  order  to  best  meet  increasingly demanding specifications.   Numerical methods used: multi-criteria optimization, parameter estimation,  dynamic programming, stochastic algorithms.    You will be offered projects under four themes:   •      Energy efficiency  •      Optimization of electric actuators  •      Optimal network management  •      Optimization of a propulsion chain     You are invited to choose the project you are most interested in under  each theme. At the end you will be assigned a single project.
