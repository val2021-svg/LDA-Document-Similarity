   ST5 - 54 - THE ECO-NEIGHBORHOOD, A COMPLEX  SYSTEM. SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT & COMPLEX   PROJECT MANAGEMENT     Dominante : CVT (Construction, City, Transportation) and GSI (Large Interacting  Systems)  Langue d’enseignement : French  Campus où le cours est proposé : Paris-Saclay        Engineering problem   The eco-neighborhood is an interesting case of a complex system. It requires  a  multidisciplinary  approach  combining  real  estate  and  construction,  mobility  (flows  and  infrastructures),  urban  networks  and  the  problems  of  consumption  of  natural  resources  (water,  energy,  waste)  but  also  geography,  sociology  and  the  history  of  places  and  people.  It  involves  implementation at various scales, from the political decisions required for  its  emergence  and  implementation,  to  the  geographical  location  of  the  catchment area and the various catchment areas for major facilities, to the  choice of heating and lighting methods for each home.   The development market is undergoing a major transformation, with public  developers ceding ground to private developers who are emerging among  the various real estate developers.   The  engineering  problematic  of  this  thematic  sequence  is  therefore  the  following: how to approach all the studies necessary to the creation of an  eco-neighborhood in order to make a coherent set of decisions?   The different pedagogical activities will allow students to acquire different  technical and managerial skills:   -  Knowing how to  design  or transform  the  complex  systems that  are econeighborhoods  by  integrating  the  many  stakeholders  with  different,  even  divergent, roles and interests,    - Take into account sustainable development parameters to ensure that the  concept of eco-neighborhood is achieved   -  Know  how  to  design  and  plan  large  complex  projects,  which  can  be  considered as multiple interdependent projects   Adviced prerequisites   Sufficient level of French to be able to read and understand texts / articles  in French   394            Context and issue modules:  This part involves major players in the field who  will share their vision and their roadmaps. It includes a presentation of the  Plateau  de  Saclay  development  project  by  the  EPAPS,  a  visit  to  a  development project that has been or is being carried out in the Ile de France  region (and if possible in Paris), and a presentation of international projects  by various players.   Specific course (60 HEE) :  Sustainable urban planning and development   Brief  description:  The  specific  course  allows  to  approach  the  main  disciplines which constitute the urban project, and to prepare the realization  during the IE of the main deliverables produced during the design phase.   Disciplines: Initiation to the game of actors and the real estate value chain,  smart  city  and  sustainable  city,  urban  and  peri-urban  agriculture,  circular  economy,  energy  issues,  the  Grand  Paris  Express  and  mobility,  urban  planning and eco-district reference.   Deliverables: Diagnosis, modeling and exploration of alternatives, economic  balance  coordinated  decisions,  schematization / representation, scenario of use situations, macro-plan.   convergence  of  multiple   sheet,   Challenge  Week  :  Design  project  for  an  eco-neighborhood  -  the  case  of  Corbeville   Associated partner: -    - Location: Paris-Saclay campus - site visit required   - Brief description: How to build the city? The city is made up of different  structures:  streets  and  public  spaces,  urban  networks  and  energy  in  particular,  public  and  individual  transport,  buildings  and  equipment...   Complex project management tools are applied here to dissect the interplay  of actors that allows the transformation of the city and to address all the  disciplines and scales of territories to achieve these major projects.    The  situation  corresponds  to  one  or  several  major  (imaginary)  modifying  scenario(s): a 20-year delay of the metro line 18 or replacement of the metro  by  a  tramway  or  any  other  scenario...  .  An  urban  design  competition  is  launched to take into account this fundamental change.   The pedagogical objectives are the following:   395      - To handle on a concrete case the main concepts, methods and tools related  to  a  complex  project  in  the  field  of  sustainable  development  and  construction.  The  generic  character  and  reusability  to  other  contexts  will  also be important.   -  Acquire  a  first  set  of  knowledge  related  to  the  sectoral  fields  of  urban  planning, real estate development, smart grids and other urban networks,  mobility (intermodality, and infrastructure) in particular.   At  the  end  of  the  IE,  students  will  have  experienced  the  decision-making  systems specific to urban development projects by having analyzed the key  stages of specification, design and planning of such projects.   396
