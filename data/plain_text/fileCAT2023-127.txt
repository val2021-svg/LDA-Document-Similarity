         ST5 - 56 - MULTI-ENERGY SYSTEMS     Dominante : ENE (Energy) and GSI (Large Interacting Systems)  Langue d’enseignement : French  Campus où le cours est proposé : Paris-Saclay        Engineering problem   The  objectives  of  reducing  energy  consumption  and  polluting  emissions  make  it  necessary  to  use  energy  systems  that  call  on  sources  with  complementary  yields  and  characteristics.  This  is  the  case  for  electricity  production  systems,  where  the  growth  of  intermittent  renewable  production  requires  more  flexibility from  conventional  production  means,  and  also  for  the  transport  sector,  where  electric  and  thermal  engines  complement each other advantageously.   These  multi-energy  systems  require  advanced  control  modes  to  take  advantage  of  the  complementarity  of  energy  sources,  and  to  satisfy  the  needs of users and the economic, technical and environmental constraints.   Advised prerequisites   It is strongly advised to have taken at least one of the SPI Transfer Sciences  or Electrical Energy courses.   Context  and  issue  modules:  This  part  is  organized  around  half-days  of  training  aiming  to  present  the  sequence,  the  integration  teaching  and  to  introduce  the  stakes  and  associated  bottlenecks,  in  particular  under  the  economic aspects and related to the social and geopolitical environment of  the topic.   Specific course (60 HEE) : Introduction to energy production   Brief description: the course is structured in two parts:   1.   Mechanical energy production   - Internal combustion engines: introduction to internal combustion engines  (architecture,  thermodynamic  cycle,  operation  and  control,  pollutant  emissions, basic sizing)  -  Turbomachinery  (wind  turbines,  hydraulic  turbines,  gas  turbines):  introduction  to  turbomachinery  (architecture,  operation,  control  modes,  interest)   413               2.   Electrical energy conversion    - Structure of alternating current machines, motor/generator operation  - Electronic converters.   - Principles for speed variation of machines (machine and converter system)   Challenge  week  n°1:  Regulation  and  control  of  energy  production  and  conversion systems   - Associated partners: EDF, GE Converteam   - Location: Paris-Saclay campus   Brief description: the objectives are :   - To be able to model an industrial physical system for a control purpose   - Understand the impact of the regulation of an installation on the overall  operation of the electrical system   - To do functional modeling to determine the control strategy of a system   - Be able to develop a control law that meets the specifications   - Take into account the specificities of the conversion elements to associate  them and create a system   Challenge week n°2: Hybrid powertrain   - Associated partner: to be confirmed   - Location: Paris-Saclay campus   - Brief description: the objectives are :   - Implement a systemic model of the hybrid powertrain   - Implement numerical processing tools under Matlab/Simulink    - Implement a control approach of the whole hybrid chain from the driver to  the wheels   - Introduction to cycle sizing: complexity of the system and contradiction of  several objectives to be achieved   Challenge week n°3: Hybrid aeronautical propulsion   - Associated partner: Safran Tech   - Location: Paris-Saclay campus   - Brief description: The integration course deals with power management in  the context of a small single-engine aircraft with a hybrid battery/fuel cell   414         energy architecture. The aircraft is propelled by a propeller powered by an  electric  motor  and  electricity  is  either  directly  drawn  from  batteries  or  generated by the combination of H2 and O2 in a fuel cell. The objectives are  as follows:   - Realize a part and then assemble the whole systemic model of the energy  architecture of the considered hybrid aircraft   - Implement the numerical resolution tools via Simulink and analyze the data  collected   -  Develop  the  regulation  strategy  of  the  system  according  to  the  given  constraints   - Critique the model used in relation to the state of the art   415
