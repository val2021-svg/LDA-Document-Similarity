   2EL6010 - Model based design of critical embedded   control systems       Instructors: Nabil Sadou  Department: CAMPUS DE RENNES  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE RENNES  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Fundamental Sciences  Advanced level : Yes      Description  Critical  embedded  control  systems  are  present  in  various  industrial  fields  (factory  4.0,  Avionics,  Railways...)  but  also  in  our  daily  live  (home  automation, automotive, medical...).    These  systems,  which  are  often  critical,  are  subject  to  robustness,  operational reliability and qualification constraints. This requires the use of  specification  methods  that  optimize  the  design  process  and  formally  guarantees  all  properties,  particularly  safety  ones.  The  development  of  certified  languages  and  tools  reduces  project  certification  costs  by  simplifying critical control applications design and automating verification,  qualifiable/certified code generation, and documentation generation.    The objective of this course is to present the different processes of critical  systems design. Based on the skills acquired in the system modeling course  (ST5), the different activities will illustrate the use of formal methods and  models in the different stages from specification to solution design and code  generation.    The  courses  also  illustrate  how  the  generated  code  is  embedded  on  a  hardware  platform  taking  into  account  execution  performance  (time  performance, sizing...). Integration, verification and validation processes will  be also presented.
