         2EL1910 - Fundamental laws of the Universe: particle   and gravitation physics       Instructors: Christophe Yèche, Samira Hassani  Department: DÉPARTEMENT PHYSIQUE  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Fundamental Sciences  Advanced level : No      Description   This course is an introduction to the four fundamental interactions: particle  physics on the one hand and gravitational physics and cosmology on the  other, from both theoretical and experimental points of view.       Quarter number  SG8     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  None     Syllabus      A. Particle physics    A.1 Historical introduction to elementary particles  A.2 Special relativity and relativistic dynamics  A.3 Fundamental Interactions  A.4 Standard model of particle physics   B. Gravitation    B.1 General relativity: principle of equivalence, equation of  motion, Einstein equation   B.2 Cosmology: geometry and expansion of the Universe, thermal  history, structure formation (CMB), dark matter, dark energy  B.3 Example of an observational cosmology project: DESI, study of  dark energy and gravitation, selection of quasars, tomography of  the Universe with quasars   153      Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)  Nine one-and-a-half-hour lectures on particle physics and nine one-and-ahalf-hour lectures on gravitation and cosmology. Six hours of TD for final  exam preparation.      Grading  The evaluation will combine a final test [75% of the grade] and a  continuous assessment [25% of the grade].    All skills will be assessed in both types of testing. But more specifically,  C21 skills will be tested mainly in the final exam, while C1-2, C2-3 and C6-3  skills will be tested in the continuous assessment and during the guided  work sessions.        Course support, bibliography  Videos, course slides, written materials and also bibliographical references  distributed during the course.     Resources    The classes will be lectures that will end with exercises counting as  continuous assessment. Slides and written material will be made available.       Learning outcomes covered on the course   - get familiar with concepts of elementary particle and fundamental  symmetry  - master the concepts of spacetime and quadrivector  - identify the relevant inertial referentials in a problem and control Lorentz  transformations.  - Understand the difference between conservation and invariance and how  to apply energy-momentum conservation in space-time.  - master the basics of tensor algebra with Einstein's notations  - calculate relativistic corrections for the Global Positioning System       Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course  C1.2 - Know how to use a model presented in the lecture in a relevant way   C1.3 - Develop a numerical simulation  C2-1 - Deepen this knowledge in particle physics and cosmology  C6-3 - Process particle physics and astrophysics data -      154
