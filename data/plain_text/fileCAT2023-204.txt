   2SC8290 - Classification of image and videos signals with   power-efficient photonic systems       Instructors: Damien Rontani  Department: DOMINANTE - PHYSIQUE ET NANOTECHNOLOGIES  Language of instruction:   Campus: CAMPUS DE METZ  Workload (HEE): 80  On-site hours (HPE): 48,00          Description    This project is part of the thematic sequence ST7 "Physical Neuro-inspired  Systems" and is about the automatic classification of image / video signals  using  photonic  architectures  developed  within  The  CentraleSupelec  Research Center. There are many applications to classification of images or  video sequences such as assistance of diagnosis in healthcare, autonomous  robotics, or scene analysis for defence and security.     Various software-based techniques exist to solve classifcation tasks and they  run on central processing units (CPU) or graphical processing units (GPU).  The  downside  is  usually  reduced  processing  speed  and  high  power  consumption  during  learning  and  testing  phase.  These  are  strong  motivations for the development of alternative hardware (physical)-based  architectures using analog electronics or photonics.    The objective of this project will be : (i) the study of the ability of a photonic  architecture to classify video or images from publicly available databases, (ii)  the optimization of its performance to be competitive with state-of-the-art  software solutions and (iii) provide an estimation of the power efficiency of  the architecture.

Numerical simulation of a large-scale neuro-inspired photonic  architecture (>10,000 interconnected dynamical systems)    •  Choice of software language : e.g. Matlab / Python or C/C++  •  Use of different learning strategies : (i) offline (e.g. linear and ridge  regression, stochastic heuristics) or (ii) online (e.g. gradient descent  and their accelerated versions).    •  Search of optimal operating points with parametric exploration   2. Handling of a publicaly available database of video or image signals    •  Choice and analysis of pre-processing algorithm for "features"   extraction suitable for classification tasks.   •  Techniques for the dimensionality reduction of the "features"   3. Experiment on prototype architecture   •  Implementation of the chosen learning technique on the physical   setup. (experimental settings and tuning done by the teaching staff)   •  Experimental campaign   4. Performance analysis    •  Performance (error / success rate in classification) and comparison   with the state of the art (bibliographic search)   •  Estimation of the power consumption for the resolution of a task  (including the energy consumption during the training and energy  use per signal processed)        Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)    This class is a small project with the following requirements :    •  team-work  (3 à 4 students) for 80 HEE (i.e. 48 HPE).  •  organization of periodic meeting with teaching staff to monitor  overall progress on the project, the code development, and for  discussing the numerical and experimental results obtained.   •  Writing one mid-term report (approx. 5 pages) on overall progress  and including some technical details and a final report (approx. 10  to 15 pages) for the last week of the class.   •  Two oral defenses : one mid-term defense (S1) only with the   teaching staff and a final defense (S2) at the end of the project with  the participation of industrial and academic partners.   627         Grading    The evaluation process is as follows :   •  Continuing evaluation (CC) on project management (including but  not limited to regular scheduling of meetings, progress, technical  mastery of the topic...). Group and invidual performance will be  taken into account and weighted equally.   •  Two oral defenses (S1 et S2) Group and invidual performance will be   taken into account and weighted equally.   •  Technical content and quality of written material (L) (reports,   bibliographic archives, commented source codes...).   Final grade = CC / 3 + (S1+S2)/6 + L/3       Resources    •  Teaching staff : Damien Rontani, Piotr Antonik  •  Desktop computers from the LMOPS laboratory of Metz Campus   and the FUSION Super Compyter (Paris-Saclay) available for  intensitve numerical simulations and parametric analysis.    •  Personal computer of students  •  Remote access to an experimental setup for testing on a prototype   architecture developed within the LMOPS laboratory on Metz  Campus      Learning outcomes covered on the course    By the end of the this project, the students will be able to    •  Numerically simulate a large-scale dynamical system with Matlab /  Python or C/C++  and apply offline and online learning techniques  for the learning of physical architectures   •  Analyze operating points and parametric mapping of performance   •  Use and apply pre-processing to publicly available database of   of physical systems   image / video signals   •  Experiment on prototype of photonic neuro-inspired architectures      Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course     C4 Have a sense of value creation for one's company and one's client  C7 know how to convince  C8 Lead a project, a team        628
