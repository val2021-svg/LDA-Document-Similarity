   2SC7210 - Game Theory for Smart Cities       Instructors: Mohamad Assaad  Department: DÉPARTEMENT SIGNAL, INFORMATION, COMMUNICATION  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 34,50      Description  This course explains the fundamental principles of game theory (rationality,  Nash  equilibrium,  correlated  equilibria,  etc.)  and  presents  the  solution  of  several  types  of  games  (finite  games  and  mixed  strategies,  revolutionary  games, repeated games, etc.). Several practical examples of the use of game  theory  in  smart  cities  are  presented  and  analyzed.  In  particular,  the  distributed  optimization  of  telecommunications  network  infrastructures,  the routing of data in networks and the problem of smart vehicle charging  are studied.
