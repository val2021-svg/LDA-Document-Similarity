   2SC5291 - Optimized biological treatment of urban   wastewater       Instructors: Cristian-Felipe Puentes Mancipe  Department: DOMINANTE - VIVANT, SANTÉ, ENVIRONNEMENT, DOMINANTE -  GRANDS SYSTÈMES EN INTERACTION  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 40  On-site hours (HPE): 27,00        Description   In urban wastewater treatment plants, biological processes are designed to  eliminate  carbon  and  nitrogen  pollution  the  action  of  through  microorganisms  that  grow  spontaneously  in  aerobic  or  anaerobic  environments.   in  the  form  of  aqueous  The  pollutants  removed  are  concentrated  suspensions  or  sludge,  which  constitutes  bulky  waste  containing  fermentable  and  toxic  materials.  The  sludge  management  is  therefore  an  important  phase  of  treatment  systems  aiming  to  ensure  the  reduction  of  their  volume  and  odour  nuisance.  One  of  the  processes  used  for  this  treatment  is  anaerobic  digestion,  which  produces  liquids  with  a  high  concentration of nitrogen that must be re-treated. The amount of nitrogen  contained  in  these  effluents  can  represent  up  to  20%  increase  in  the  nitrogen  load  to  be  eliminated  by  the  plant.  There  are  two  solutions  to  address  this  problem:  (1)  a  so-called  classical  one,  in  which  these  concentrated effluents are directly returned to the primary plant, or (2) the  anaerobic  ammonium  oxidation  process,  or  Anammox,  an  innovative  alternative to traditional nitrification/denitrification processes, allowing the  direct transformation of nitrite and ammonium into gaseous dinitrogen.    The objective of this ‘challenge week’ is to develop control strategies for the  two  solutions  mentioned  in  order  to  meet  the  minimum  treatment  requirements  of  the  treated  water  and  to  compare  their  performance  in  terms of operating costs and biogas production as a vector for sludge energy  recovery.       Quarter number  ST5     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  There are no specific prerequisites.    374        Syllabus  -    Introduction on pollution, water and sludge treatment technologies.  -    Presentation on the modeling of water treatment plants: focus on the  formulation of the activated sludge reactor model and the moving-bed  reactor (MBBR).   -    Simulation of the classical process with constant and variable feed flow.  Understanding of unit processes, impact of operating parameters on  effluent composition, dynamics of microbial populations.    -    Simulation of the Anammox process with constant and variable feed  flow. Understanding of the functioning of unitary processes, impact of  operating parameters on the composition of the effluent, dynamics of  microbial populations.  -    Proposal of PID regulation strategy in order to respect the imposed  depollution specifications. Adjustment of the PID controller parameters by  an empirical method of trial and error calibration. Evaluation of the quality  of the controllers (static error, response time, overshoot, disturbance  absorption).  -    Comparison of the two processes on the basis of operating costs  (additional carbon input and electricity consumption for aeration needs),  sludge production and biogas production by anaerobic digestion.     Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)  The teaching team and the industrial partner will carry out a first session to  introduce the problem.  A presentation on the modeling approach of water  treatment  plants  will  be  proposed  with  a  focus  on  biological  treatment  reactors. Then, the students will be divided into teams. All the teams will  work  on  the  same  specifications,  so that  they  can  deal  with both process  engineering and control aspects of the teaching.  Scientific articles and technical documentation will be provided for further  study  of  the  concepts  covered.  A  written  procedure  for  the  empirical  adjustment  of  PID  parameters  in  the  simulation  software  will  also  be  provided.  Finally, each team will propose a control strategy to the partner, which will  include the comparison and critical analysis of the two processes.     Grading  The evaluation is based on: continuous assessment, a written report, an  oral evaluation.
