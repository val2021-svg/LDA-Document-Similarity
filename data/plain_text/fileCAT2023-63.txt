   2EL2410 - Signal compression and denoising       Instructors: Gilles Chardon  Department: DÉPARTEMENT SIGNAL, INFORMATION, COMMUNICATION  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Fundamental Sciences  Advanced level : Yes      Description   This course is an introduction to signal and image representations, analysis,  compression and denoising, fundamentals of modern signal processing for  music and video storage, image enhancing in smartphones, processing and  medical and astrophysical images, etc.    With  the  ever  increasing  quantity  of  collected  and  stored  data,  signal  compression (images, sounds, videos...) remains a major challenge in data  sciences,  limiting  the  amount  of  necessary  storage,  and  data  transfers  on  telecommunication  networks.  Image  restoration  techniques  (of  which  denoising  is  a  particular  example)  are  used  on  recent  smartphones  to  mitigate the limitations of photographic sensors in resolution and sensibility.    A common point of the methods introduced in this course is their frugality  in computations, energy, and data necessary for their development and use.    After  recalling  fundamentals  of  signal  processing  and  harmonic  analysis  (filters, Fourier transform and series, random processes...), a first overview  of signal denoising and compression will be given by Wiener filtering and LPC  coding of speech.    The introduction of entropy coding will allow the design of lossless coders  for images (PNG) and sounds (FLAC).    Lossy compression algorithms, with superior compression rates, will then be  considered (JPEG, MP3, etc.).    Finally, wavelet orthogonal bases will be defined, with applications in image  compression (JPEG2000), and non-linear image denoising.
