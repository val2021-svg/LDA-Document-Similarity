   2EL6110 - Advanced computer networks       Instructors: Jean-Francois Lalande  Department: CAMPUS DE RENNES  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE RENNES  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Engineering Sciences  Advanced level : Yes        Description   This elective course is part of the InfoSec Track, but is accessible to any 2nd  year  student  validating  the  prerequisites.  It  aims  to  present  advanced  concepts  of  Computer  Networks  architecture  and  is  based  on  the  fundamental  concepts  presented  in  the  elective  course  "Network  and  Security " of 1st year.  The  classic  paradigms  of  Computer  Networks  related  to  the  creation  of  Internet (layered models, TCP/IP protocols, client/server model, etc.) have  become widely adopted. However, changes in user needs in terms of data  availability and  volumetrics  as  well as  the  emergence  of  new  applications  and  new  services  (support  of  "heavy"  applications  as  Wep  Apps,  Cloud  Computing,  cryptocurrency,  etc.)  lead  to  significant  changes  in  traditional  architectures of Information Systems. These architectural evolutions, as well  as the rise of associated technologies, can also be explained by two current  trends:  - The outsourcing of network and hosting infrastructures, and even of  applications themselves;  - The optimisation of the use of these infrastructures.    This implies in particular:  -  Dynamic,  on-demand  adaptation  capabilities,  including  the  ability  to  distribute  storage  and  processing  but  also  to  quickly  reconfigure  infrastructures;  -  Resource  sharing  capabilities  (compute,  storage  and  network),  generally  based on the virtualization of infrastructures;  - The use of decentralized, peer-to-peer models;  - Scalable resource allocation models, etc.       Quarter number  SG6    314        Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  1CC1000 - Information Systems and Software Development  1EL6000 - Computer Networks and Security       Syllabus  Lessons 1 to 5 (7,5h):  - Cloud computing  - Data center networks  - Software-Defined Networking (SDN)  Lessons 6 and 7 (3h):  - IPv6  Lab (3h):  - IPv6  Lessons 8 and 9 (3h):  - Distributed Architectures (Cluster)  - Distributed File Systems  - Cluster Management, 0rchestration  - Load Balancing  Lessons 10 and 11 (3h):  - Message queuing systems    Laboratory study (15,5h): implementation of a software network and a  distributed service with OpenStack       Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)   A large place is left to practical aspects.  The lectures are punctuated with demonstrations and manipulations.  A long-term laboratory study, including a part of homework, makes it  possible to gradually implement the technologies presented in classroom.     Grading  Final written exam: coefficient 0.5. Defence of the laboratory study:  coefficient 0.5.  The lab study is always taken into account in the final mark (N1), even if it  is lower than the mark of the written exam.

Learning outcomes covered on the course  At the end of this course, students will be able to:  - design an architecture based on an Infrastructure as a Service;  - deploy an IPv6 network using dedicated address attribution mechanisms;  - deploy and configure a message broker for distributed applications;  - explain the principles of elasticity and resource management in Cloud  Computing;  - explain the principles and pro & cons of resource virtualization;  - explain the principles of peer-to-peer networks for data exchange or  Blockchain management.       Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course  C1.1 -  Analyze: study a system as a whole, the situation as a whole.  Identify, formulate and analyze a system within a transdisciplinary  approach with its scientific, economic, human dimensions, etc.  C2.1 - Deepen a field of engineering sciences or a scientific discipline  C7.1 - Know how to convince: Structure ideas and arguments, be synthetic  (assumptions, objectives, expected results, approach, and created value)   316
