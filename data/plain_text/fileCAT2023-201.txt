   2SC8193 - Optimization of civil engineering structures in   additive concrete manufacturing       Instructors: Camille Gandiolle  Department: DOMINANTE - CONSTRUCTION VILLE TRANSPORTS  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 80  On-site hours (HPE): 48,00          Description   Project to answer a problem proposed by a partner of the civil engineering  industry around the optimization of the design of a part in additive  manufacturing concrete or plaster.       Quarter number  ST7     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)   To have completed the “continuum mechanic” SPI course and at least one  of the following courses: Materials, Transport phenomena,  Thermodynamic.       Syllabus  Students are divided into teams of up to 5. Each team must optimize the  design of a large civil engineering part subjected to complex mechanical  and even multiphysical loads. This may involve optimize its geometry, to  think about its design, to design a system for a given use system for a given  use, analyze the performance of a part already designed by already  designed by additive manufacturing... This work must take into account the  This work must take into account the specific capabilities and restrictions  of the concrete or plaster additive manufacturing process.    step 1: Getting to know the subject  step 2 : Simplified representation of the studied part to reach a first  optimum  first optimum on a first field of parameters.  step 3 : Optimization of the system in a new space of parameters closer to  the real system modeled by advanced methods.   618      step 4 : Analysis of the cost benefits of the proposed solution compared to  the usual solution e.g. manufacturing time, cost of materials, manpower  used, environmental compatibility...    Most topics involve finite element simulation on COMSOL or the software  of the students' choice. Some topics may involve Some topics may involve  experimentation.      Grading  C2 and C8 skills will be evaluated throughout the project, which will end  with a defense in the presence of the industrial partner. Competencies C2  and C7 will be evaluated during the defense. The partner will evaluate the  C4 competence.  Continuous assessment during the project (C2, C8) : N1  Teachers' grade for the oral defense (C2, C7) : N2  Industrial partners' mark for the oral defense (C2, C4, C7) : N3  NF = 30%N1 +30%N2 + 40%N3        Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course  C2 Develop in-depth skills in an engineering field and a family of  professions  C4 Have a sense of value creation for his company and his customers  C7 Know how to convince  C8 Lead a project, a team        619
