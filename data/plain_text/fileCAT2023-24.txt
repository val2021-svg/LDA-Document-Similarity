   2EL1320 - Energy conversion       Instructors: Bruno Lorcet  Department: DÉPARTEMENT SYSTÈMES D'ÉNERGIE ÉLECTRIQUE  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Engineering Sciences  Advanced level : Yes      Description    The design of systems for the production and use of energy must now be  done with respect for the environment and with strict criteria for sustainable  development. In addition, the availability of energy in a suitable form is the  key  to  developing  new  applications  in  all  areas,  from  transportation  to  mobile device design. Thus, all sectors of activity must today be given the  means to master electrical energy, the only vector capable of meeting these  needs.The  energy  conversion  course  introduces  the  main  objects,  motors  and  generators,  allowing  transformations  between  electrical  energy  and  mechanical  energy.  It  also  deals  with  principles  and  electronic  devices  to  optimize  the  transfer  of  energy  between  source  and  electric  load.  The  converters  concerned  are  ubiquitous  in  the  transport  of  energy  and  renewable energies, but also in most modern objects consuming electricity.   The course begins with the positioning of the principles and systems that will  be studied in relation to the basics already acquired by students in the field  of electrical energy. The focus is on the industrial and economic stakes of  energy management.The first part of the course is devoted to the study of  AC  rotating  electrical  machines,  which  are  today  major  players  in  the  production and consumption of electrical energy. Based on the basics of lowfrequency electromagnetism and mechanics, the principles of synchronous  and  asynchronous  machine  operation  are  introduced  in order to  obtain a  circuit model that can be used in a steady state. It then becomes possible to  draw up an energetic balance of the conversion and to present some modes  of  piloting.In  a  second  part,  we  discuss  the  components  and  electronic  power converters. The importance of electronic switching operation and its  connection  with  the  topological  and  thermal  aspects  of  the  design  is  emphasized. The various structures are then presented using a methodology  that  allows  classification  of  the  converters  according  to  the  sources  and  electrical  loads  concerned  and  the  possible  reversibility  of  the  energy  transfer.   87           Quarter number    SG6     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)    SPI course 1A "Electric energy" or equivalent     Syllabus     Introduction  Energy conversion and electrical engineering  General Concepts on AC Machines  Sinusoidal field distribution - Rotating field creation - Practical  realization  Synchronous machine in steady state  Principle and practical realization - Fundamental equations - Equivalent  diagram - Alternator operation - Motor use  Asynchronous motor in steady state  Principle and practical realization - Fundamental equations - Equivalent  scheme - Implementation on a fixed frequency network - Variable  frequency power supply  Basics of power electronics  Principles of static converters: realized functions, classical structures -  Ideal switch, real switches: switching regime, losses - Main  components: fundamental properties, control principles, areas of use,  limits  DC-DC converters  Objectives - Chopper: fundamental structures - Different operating  regimes - Reversibility - Applications  DC to AC converters  Objectives - Single-phase inverters: fundamental structures -  Operation modes, control laws - Three-phase inverters  AC-DC converters  Objectives - Rectifier bridges: single-phase and three-phase basic  assemblies - Reversibility, line commutated inverter - Impact on the  power source, power factor      Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)    L(1-6) // T1-TL(7-10) // L(11-12) // T2-TL(13-16) // L(17-18) //T3-TL(19-22)//  EE    88        Grading    The evaluation will be done by a written examination of 2 hours with  documents.
