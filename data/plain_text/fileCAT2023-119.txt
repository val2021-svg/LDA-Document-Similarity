   2SC5390 - Design of a "last mile" urban delivery system   using autonomous and connected vehicles       Instructors: Morgan Roger  Department: DOMINANTE - SYSTÈMES COMMUNICANTS ET OBJETS CONNECTÉS  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 40  On-site hours (HPE): 27,00      Description  The challenges of autonomous and connected vehicles do not only concern  the automotive sector. The integration teaching offered here allows you to  understand  on  the  one  hand  the  approach  of  designing  a  complex  and  critical  system,  and  on  the  other  hand  the  plurality  of  problems  of  the  autonomous  and  connected  vehicle,  through  an  industrial  scenario  in  an  adapted context.    The chosen scenario is that of a so-called “last mile” delivery. The cost and  delivery  time  of  a  parcel  by  carrier  is  strongly  impacted  by  the  last  mile,  especially  in  urban  areas.  Due  to  traffic  jams  and  parking,  delivery  trucks  could advantageously be picked up at the entrance to major cities by lighter  means of transport adapted to the urban environment. Using bikes is too  expensive; the carriers consider in the short term a fully automated delivery  on the last mile. The solution consists in managing a fleet of autonomous  and  connected  robots  carrying  out  deliveries,  based  on  arrival  times,  delivery addresses and characteristics of the robots.    You  work  in  a  team  in  charge  of  designing  such a  delivery  system.  In this  context, you follow a model-oriented system engineering process to specify  the  functionality  of  the  system.  You  adopt  a  modeling  methodology  to  develop the necessary algorithms (control / command, sensor fusion, data  fusion, decision making and telecommunications) to meet the specifications.  A reduced-scale test platform allows you to assess the quality of the delivery  system obtained and improve the algorithms.     Quarter number  ST5     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)   1st-year SPI module "Electronic systems"  1st-year SPI module "Network security"  Specific teaching module "Architecture and technologies for smart and  connected vehicules"   391           Syllabus  The following technical aspects are implemented in this integration  teaching:   •  functional needs analysis, system specifications  •  system modeling  •  state machines  •  control law  •  telecommunications  •  communications protocol  •  image processing  •  sensor fusion  •  embedded and real-time processing  •  mixed hardware-software computation        Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)    The objective is to complete a technical proof of concept on a reduced-scale  platform  made  up  of  robots  rolling  on  an  adapted  support  schematically  representing the urban environment. Teams of 5 or 6 students are formed  beforehand  so  as  to  present  a  broad  spectrum  of  skills.  After  an  initial  functional analysis of the system based on brainstorming, the teams decide  on  their  internal  organization  in  order  to  deal  with  the  various  aspects  in  parallel and with consistency: hardware, modeling, embedded intelligence,  connectivity. Each team is given a robot and can access the test rooms to  validate the behavior of the system in a physical environment and refine its  functionality. The last day of the week is devoted to the preparation of the  evaluation and to the evaluation itself.     Grading    The grading is done through regular progress reports with the supervision  team during the week (once per half-day), as well as with a final evaluation  at  the  end  of  the  week,  comprising  an  oral  presentation  describing  the  design choices and the innovations of the system, and a demonstration of  its performances on the test platform, in front of  a panel of teachers and  industrial experts.      Resources     Human resources: a team of teachers specializing in the various engineering  fields  concerned  (electronics,  telecommunications,  modeling,  signal  processing) present 100% of the time; automotive (Renault) and modeling   392      (Mathworks) industrial experts visiting during the week and present for the  evaluation.  Logistical resources: working rooms for student teams, large rooms for test  and evaluation platforms, a teachers' HQ.  Material resources: rolling robots (including 4 driving wheels, an Arduino  board, a Raspberry Pi nanocomputer, a camera and several other on-board  sensors, batteries).  Software resources: Matlab / Simulink, Linux, Python, C ++, OpenCV, ...        Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course    The following skills will be evaluated during this learning activity: C2, C4  and C7. The skills assessment will be based on the regular progress reports  with the supervision team (once per half-day), on the demonstrated  performances of the system, and on the final oral presentation.        393
