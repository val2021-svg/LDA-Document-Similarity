   2SC7290 - Smart cities: connected cities       Instructors: Mohamad Assaad  Department: DOMINANTE - SYSTÈMES COMMUNICANTS ET OBJETS CONNECTÉS  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 80  On-site hours (HPE): 48,00      Description   The  projects  are  centered  around  practical  applications  of  optimization  (combinatorial, convex) and game theory to the current problems of smart  cities.  The  projects  will  be  multidisciplinary  and  will  serve  to  put  into  perspective  the  courses  of  ST7  and  to  introduce  students  to  engineering  problems  and/or  scientific  research  in  the  field.  Examples  of  projects:  gathering and routing of data in smart cities, route optimization for cycling,  optimisation  strategies  for  charging  bikes  at  station,  electrical  consumed  energy forecasting, etc.      Quarter number  ST7     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  Communication networks (basics), optimization, Matlab     Syllabus   Examples  of  projects:  gathering  and  routing  of  data  in  smart  cities,  route  optimization for cycling, optimisation strategies for charging bikes at station,  electrical consumed energy forecasting, etc.   The practical context of the project is related to a precise service in smart  cities  (information  gathering  from  sensors,  temperature  regulation,  video  surveillance, consumption of electric energy, route optimization for cycling,  etc.)  and  it  will  be  given  as  a  complement  to  the  courses.  Students  will  propose  and  implement  convex  optimization  or  game  theory   algorithms  seen in the courses. They will then test their approaches on potentially in  real data.        Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)  Each project is assigned on average to five students and is mainly supervised  by  a  professor.  Some  projects  are  jointly  proposed  with  some  industrial  partners and are hence co-supervised by engineers from these companies.  A  room  dedicated  to  the  projects  will  be  available  to  students.  The  supervisors  will  follow  up  regularly  (one  meeting  /  group  /  week  at  the   511      beginning  and  one  daily  meeting  per  group  during  the  final  week).  Inter  group  collaboration  will  be  encouraged  (whenever  it  is  possible),  and  students will be assessed on their ability to work in teams (leadership, tasks'  sharing, communication).     Grading  report to write+defense (per group)      Resources  software to use: Matlab     Learning outcomes covered on the course  At the end of the project the student will be able to:     1- know emerging problems in smart cities (telecommunication networks,  routing of data, smart charging, etc.)  2- model a network in the context of smart cities with its main functions   3- formulate emerging problems in smart cities as optimization frameworks  4-implement convex optimization and game theory methods in Matlab          Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course   C1 : Analyse, design and implement complex systems made up of scientific,  technological, social and economic dimensions.
