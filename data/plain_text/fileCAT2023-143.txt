   2SC5910 - Control of a motorization chain       Instructors: Jean-Louis Gutzwiller  Department: CAMPUS DE METZ  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE METZ  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 34,50          Description  This course covers the necessary concepts to control a motorization chain in  its  electronic  aspects  (converters,  power,  power  supply),  servo  control  (modelling,  observers,  regulators)  and  digital  (analog-digital  conversion,  programming,  real-time).  The  practical  aspects  will  be  tested  on  microcontroller cards to concretely implement a speed control system of a  DC motor.     Quarter number  ST5     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  None     Syllabus       • DC motor       • DC-DC converters       • Mechanical modelling       • Synthesis of control laws (analog regulation and digital regulation)       • Non-linear regulation       • Microcontroller programming     Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)  12h of lecture, 6h of tutorials, 15h of labs and 1h30 for the final exam.   24 students for tutorial/labs groups       Grading   A written report on the practical work, to be given on the date indicated by  the teacher,  will  be  requested  and  a  one-and-a-half hour  individual  exam  will  take  place  at  the  end  of  the  course.  The  score  of  the  individual  examination will count for 60% and the score of the practical work report   459      will count for 40% of the final grade. In case of absence, the standard penalty  according to the regulations will be applied.    If the exam fails, a remedial exam will take place in the form of a one-anda-half hour individual written exam.        Course support, bibliography  « Commande des entraînements à vitesse variable », handout.     Resources   Lectures will be given to present the main concepts.  Applications will be tested on electronic cards during tutorial courses.    Tutorial groups size : 24 students  Lab groups size : 24 students       Learning outcomes covered on the course  - Understanding how motors work  - Choose the characteristics and performances adapted to the problem  - Develop the command laws  - Mastering the servo systems     Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course    •  C1 :  Analyze, design, and build complex systems with scientific,   technological, human, and economic components   •  C2 : Develop in-depth skills in an engineering field and a family of   professions   460
