2EL6140 - Electric machinery, power electronics and   grids.          Instructors: Herve Gueguen  Department: CAMPUS DE RENNES  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE RENNES  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Engineering Sciences  Advanced level : Yes      Description   The supply of electricity to isolated sites such as islands has  some specific  characteristics due to the small size of their power grid. This leads to a high  risk of instability and therefore the control of a microgrid, including all its  electrical components, is crucial for its proper operation.   This elective proposes to study this issue from two perspectives:   •  Electrical engineering: presentation of the key electrical   components of an alternating microgrid   •  Automatic control: implementation of control techniques on these  components and introduction to the control of large-scale systems  (i.e. how to go beyond the “classical” control theory which only  deals with 2-3 variables).   Note:  the  electrical  engineering  program  of  this  elective  is  close  to  the  “Energy Conversion” elective offered in Paris-Saclay. The automatic control  part is unique to this elective.        Quarter number  SG8     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)   Power systems concepts you need to know (e.g. by having taken the firstyear elective “Electrical Energy (ENE)”):   •  Power in AC regime: P (active), Q (reactive) and S (apparent)  •  Three-phase electric power system: phase-to-neutral and phase-to phase voltages   324   Control theory concepts you need to know (e.g. by having followed the ST5  common course on automatic control):   •  Modeling a system by a transfer function  •  Regulation of a linear system by a PID controller   Having taken the ST7 “Smart grids and energy challenge: energy  management in isolated sites” would be a plus, but is not a prerequisite, as  the topics addressed are very different:   •  ST7 “Renewable energies and microgrids” course: high level   modeling (energy flows), with economic optimization.   •  this elective: voltage/current modeling and more detailed analysis   of electrical components and their low-level regulation.         Syllabus   This elective belongs to both electrical engineering and automatic control,  with  extra  transversal  and  practical  skills  on  the  analysis  and  control  of  systems thanks to the intensive use of a modeling and simulation software.   For the electrical part, the aim is to understand the operation and modeling  of the energy conversion components of a microgrid:   •  power electronics converters (choppers and inverters)  •  AC electric machines (synchronous and asynchronous)   This knowledge is presented through lectures and exercise sessions.   For  the  automatic  control  part,  the  aim  is  to  understand  the  control  and  regulation  strategies  of  microgrid  components,  in  particular  the  power  electronics converters. In addition, this part includes an introduction to the  control of large-scale systems (the microgrid with its many components).   This  automatic  control  part  is  mainly  conducted  as  hands-on  sessions  on  computers.  These  sessions  are  an  opportunity  to  intensively  practice  a  modeling  and  simulation  tool  (Simulink/Simscape).  One  of  the  issues  addressed  is  the  choice  of  a  level  of  details  in  the  model  adapted  to  the  objective  fidelity…).  This  transversal skill is meant to be transposable to other engineering fields.   (compromise  between  simplicity,  speed,   Note:  the  optimization  of  power  flows  (power  dispatch)  to  ensure  the  economically optimal operation of a microgrid is not addressed. Indeed, this  issue  is  part  of  the  ST7 optimization project.  “Smart  grids  and  the  energy  challenge: energy management in isolated sites”.   325           Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)   Lecture  sesssions  aim  at  acquiring  basic  knowledge  in  the  field  of  power  systems. These sessions include exercises on paper.   The practical sessions are done on computers (Matlab/Simulink). Computer  work can be done in pairs. The time devoted to these sessions is substantial  to allow the students to become fully comfortable with the simulation tool.   Lectures:  9  hours,  Tutorials:  9  hours,  Laboratories:  15  hours,  Evaluation  (written exam): 2 hours.   The evaluation of the lecture sessions is one final written exam.   The evaluation of the computer lab sessions is done by checking the progress  along the sessions and by a final synthesis report.   The weighting between the lecture part and the practical part is 50%, 50%.
