   2SC5891 - Design of a safe signaling system for the   railways       Instructors: Idir Ait Sadoune  Department: DOMINANTE - INFORMATIQUE ET NUMÉRIQUE  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 40  On-site hours (HPE): 27,00        Description   The aim is to discover critical systems modeling activities in railway systems,  by using the CLEARSY Safety Platform and by proving some safety properties.  During this project, several safety functions will be developed, implemented  and improved, mainly using Boolean expressions. Such a system usually has  hundreds  or  thousands  of  equations,  it  is  understood  that  this  project  addresses only a subset of them.  Signaling system control is a risky activity since an error could allow:  - a train derailing.  - two trains colliding.  We will focus on the logical functions that allow a train to make a safe trip  for the chosen route topology.
