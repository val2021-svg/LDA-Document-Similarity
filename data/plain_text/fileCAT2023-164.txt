      ST7 - 72 - OPTIMIZATION OF NETWORK  INFRASTRUCTURE FOR SMART CITIES      Dominante : SCOC (Systèmes Communicants et Objets Connectés)  Teaching Language : English  Campus: Paris-Saclay        Introduction    The advent of the Internet of Things and the proliferation of applications  based  on  cheap  sensor  networks  are  now  paving  the  way  for  the  development  of  smart,  connected  and  sustainable  cities.  Many  cities  in  Europe  (Antony,  Dijon,  Malaga,  Santander,  Barcelona,  etc.)  are  in  the  process  of  creating  intelligent  environments  with  experiments  deployed  for  better  adaptive  management  of  traffic  and  transport,  for  better  management of energy and water consumption, for reduction of CO2 and  pollution  level,  and  for  a  better  quality  of  life,  etc.  The  creation  and  management  of  smart  cities  require  high-speed  communications  infrastructures  and  edge  networks  for  the  collection,  delivery  and  processing  of  a  large  amount  of  information  (traffic  sensors,  cameras,  localizable vehicles, profiles and movements of users / people, etc.), which  will overload  current  telecommunications networks  and  /  or  require  the  development  of  new  communication  systems.  It  is  estimated  that  the  density of connected objects in smart cities will reach one million objects  per km2 in the next years. Obviously, the optimization of communications  networks is essential in this case. In this context, one of the main objectives  of the fifth generation of communications systems is to be able to meet  the needs of smart cities, in particular by allowing the communication of a  large number of machines, the virtualization of network functions, and the  intelligent data processing. This ST will present the current challenges and  problems of smart cities, through interventions by the main actors in the  field.  The  fundamental  principles  of  game  theory  (rationality,  Equilibria,  etc.) will then be explained in detail and several practical examples of the  use of this theory to solve smart city problems will also be presented and  analyzed.      Prerequisites   Basics in Modelling and signal processing.   506              Context  and  Challenges  Modules:  These  modules  include  seminars  on  smart  cities  (issues,  challenges,  and  experiments),  a  Panel  dedicated  to  markets and economic models confronting the visions of the main actors  in  the  field,  as  well  as  presentations  by  industrial  partners  focusing  on  technological and scientific challenges.   Specific Course (60 HEE): Game Theory for smart cities    -  Brief description: This course explains the fundamental principles of game  theory  (rationality,  Nash  equilibrium,  correlated  equilibria,  etc.)  and  presents the solution of several types of games (finite games and mixed  strategies,  revolutionary  games,  repeated  games,  etc.).  Several  practical  examples  of  the  use  of  game  theory  in  smart  cities  are  presented  and  analyzed. In particular, the distributed optimization of telecommunications  network infrastructures, the routing of data in networks and the problem  of intelligent vehicle charging are studied.     Project : Smart cities : the connected cities    -  Partners : Orange, Nokia, Thales   -  Place: Paris-Saclay   -  Brief description: The projects are centered around practical applications  of  optimization  (combinatorial,  convex)  and  game  theory  to  the  current  problems  of  smart  cities.  The  projects  will  be  multidisciplinary  and  will  serve to put into perspective the courses of ST7 and to introduce students  to engineering problems and/or scientific research in the field.    Examples  of  projects:  collect  and  routing  of  data  in  smart  cities,  route  optimization  for  cycling,  optimization  strategies  for  charging  bikes  at  station, electrical consumed energy forecasting, etc.    The practical context of the project is related to a precise service in smart  cities (information gathering from sensors, temperature regulation, video  surveillance,  consumption  of  electric  energy,  route  optimization  for  cycling, etc.) and it will be given as a complement to the courses. Students  will  propose  game  theory algorithms seen in the courses. They will then test their approaches  on potentially real data.    convex  optimization  or   implement   and      507
