   2EL2210 - Operations and supply chain management       Instructors: Guillaume LAMÉ  Department: DÉPARTEMENT GÉNIE INDUSTRIEL ET OPÉRATIONS  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Business Sciences  Advanced level : No      Description  This module provides an introduction to challenges in the management of  operations and supply chains. It explores decisions involved in designing,  planning and piloting production and distribution systems, both for goods  and services. The main challenge in these systems is to ensure that the  right product or service is delivered at the right place and the right time, in  the quantity and at the quality required by the customer, while making  efficient use of resources.  In  this  context,  it  is  crucial  to  understand  industrial  systems  at  different  levels (supply chain, factory, warehouse, workshops, machine), to identify  processes, to assess economic and environmental challenges and to develop  quantitative and qualitative methods and tools to improve the performance  of these systems.    Examples will be drawn from various industrial sectors.        Quarter number  SG8     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  None      Syllabus  This module will explore:    • The organisational dimension of production and distribution systems  • The performance of production systems through different perpectives   • Qualitative and quantitative methods aimed at improving the  performance of production and distribution systems   • The implementation of these approaches, including feasibility,  adaptability, limitations and change management   195           Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)  Lectures and applications on exercises and study cases.
