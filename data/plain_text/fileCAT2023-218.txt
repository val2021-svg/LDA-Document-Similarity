   2IN5030 - Experimental physics work       Instructors: Brahim Dkhil  Department: DÉPARTEMENT PHYSIQUE  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 40  On-site hours (HPE): 27,00  Elective Category : Fundamental Sciences  Advanced level : No      Description  It  is  an  experimental  learning  in  physics  that  aims  to  (i)  illustrate  and  experimentally apply the content of CentraleSupélec's physics teaching, (ii)  demonstrate creativity and initiative, (iii) work in groups and in a concerted  manner, (iv) transmit knowledge. In order to achieve these objectives, the  pupils  will  have  at  their  disposal  a  set  of  equipment  and  apparatus  from  which, with the help of their teachers/teachers, they will have to imagine  and implement their own experiments in order to illustrate the following 5  physical  themes:  structure  of  matter,  radiation-matter  interaction,  phase  transition, transport phenomena, energy conversion.     Quarter number  Intensive week  of the SG6 and SG8     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  Basics in Physics     Syllabus  Each group will be made up of 10 students divided into 5 pairs (one pair =  one  physical  theme)  and  must  have  a  common  thread  (guideline).  The  capacity  of  reception  and  supervision  (4  teachers)  allows  a  total  of  30  students.   At the beginning of the sequence, during two half-day sessions, which will  be called "preparatory" sessions, and with all the supervisors, the students  will have to divide themselves up and will have the free will to define their  common  thread  and  the  experiences  they  will  have  to  implement  and  present in April over 4 days.  During  the  preparatory sessions,  the  students will  have  access  to  a  list of  equipment and materials (visit to the InnoPhysLab room + SPMS laboratory  equipment)  which  will  be  made  fully  available  to  them  to  carry  out  their  experiments. Within a certain limit and according to the needs expressed,   659      small additional equipment may be purchased to complete the equipment  already made available.   Each group will have 4 days to set up their experiments in accordance with  the physical themes, to take measurements, to criticize the results, and to  make  a  "youtube"  type  video  which  will  be  submitted  to  an  external  committee of physics teachers from CentraleSupélec.      Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)  2 sessions of 3 hours to prepare the experimental work  4 days of 7.5 hours of experimental work implementation and presentation     Grading  The evaluation is based on the behaviour and work done during the  experimental sessions as well as on the video realized by the students  which aims at describing their work      Resources  4 teachers for 30 students distributed into 3 groups of 10 students  Acces to InnoPhys room and SPMS lab equipments     Learning outcomes covered on the course  consolidate their knowledge in Physics  knowhow for mounting an experiment  work in a groupe, exchange and orgnaize the work  develop creativity and initiative  learn how to transmit their knowledge     660
