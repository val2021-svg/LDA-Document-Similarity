   2EL2040 - Chemical Engineering: application to   environment and sustainable production       Instructors: François Puel, Julien Colin  Department: DÉPARTEMENT MÉCANIQUE ENERGÉTIQUE PROCÉDÉS  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY, CAMPUS DE METZ  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Engineering Sciences  Advanced level : No      Description   Process  Engineering  consists  in  designing,  operating  and  optimizing  processes  for  the  development  of  various  products  and  services  in  many  traditional and high-tech sectors (agri-food, biotechnology, cosmetics, fine  chemicals, materials, oil, pharmaceuticals, water and waste treatment, etc.)  and for the production of traditional, low-carbon and renewable energies.  This course is an introduction to Process and Bioprocess Engineering and its  methodologies. The fundamentals of the course allow students to acquire  general tools that can be easily transposed to multiple fields.    The sustainability of processes is a major challenge.  Some  processes  are  intrinsically  key  tools  in  the  global  sustainable  development  strategy  at  different  scales  (local  and  global),  such  as  the  recycling and recovery of many products and the purification of liquid and  gaseous effluents.  Nevertheless,  in  general,  new  processes  must  be  developed  and  existing  processes must be optimized (intensification) in order to reduce the impacts  of the industrial sector. The challenges associated with this environmental  dynamic are multiple: reduction of energy and raw material consumption,  costs, waste, risks and dangers.  In addition, bioprocesses have developed very strongly in the last decades  for two reasons: (i) the use of living organisms, acting as processing plants,  to  transform  matter,  purify  polluted  systems  (liquid,  solid),  (ii)  the  use  of  biomass to replace fossil resources.    This course is based on concrete examples (simplified in order to make them  intelligible), allowing students to apply and learn the fundamentals of the  course,  while  focusing  on  processes  oriented  towards  sustainable  development.  Some  case  studies  are  focused  on  bioprocesses  used  in  industrial  and  environmental  biotechnology.  Bioprocesses  are  studied  at  the  industrial  bioreactor scale. The description and understanding of biological processes   169      (metabolism,  maintenance,  etc.)  at  the  cell  level  are  not  addressed.  The  biological agents are thus considered as cellular catalysts transforming raw  materials  into  products  according  to  given  kinetic  laws  whose  application  does not need any specific background in biology.

Removal of a pollutant (environmental  process)  Biogas purification for biomethane production by membrane technology  (production of a renewable energy carrier for conventional uses)        Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)    The course module is organized in lectures (16.5h), to introduce knowledge  and methodological tools, which will be then applied through case studies  (16.5h). The pedagogical mode of the lectures (face-to-face or flipped  classroom) will be decided collectively during the first lesson. The case   170      studies will be conducted in class. The students will be in groups and will  produce a report to be submitted at the end of each lesson. Two of the  case studies will consist of mini-projects to be carried out by groups in  autonomy during 3 hours.        Grading  Homework: Presentation, by group, of a litterature survey whose topic is  an extension of the course (40% of the grade); this presentation may take  place either by an oral session of by a poster session take place .Individual  final written exam: 2-hour case study (60% of the grade).
