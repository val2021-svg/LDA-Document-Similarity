         ST7 - 82 - PHYSICAL NEURO-INSPIRATORY SYSTEMS FOR   INFORMATION PROCESSING     Dominante : PNT (Physics and NanoTechnology)  Langue d’enseignement : English  Campus où le cours est proposé : Metz        Engineering problem   In  a  context  of  constant  increase  of  the  volume  of  information  to  be  processed,  it  is  necessary  to  define  new  analysis  strategies.  Automatic  classification methods based on machine learning are promising, but their  numerical  implementations  remain  slow  and  very  energy-consuming.  An  alternative  solution  consists  in  designing  hardware  architectures  called  neuro-inspired, which allow to lift a large part of these barriers. This theme  is attracting growing interest both in fundamental research and among startups and large high-tech groups such as IBM and Google.    In this context, and through a specific architecture known as the reservoir  computer (an artificial neural network for which only a final reading layer is  trained), we propose to students to discover the design principles of physical  neural networks. For this, students will use many optimization techniques  such as ridge regression and gradient descent, as well as their accelerated  versions,  or  stochastic  heuristics  (e.g.  simulated  annealing,  genetic  algorithms).    The objective will be to simulate and test a prototype of a physical neuroinspired processing architecture comprising several tens, even hundreds of  thousands of neurons and to demonstrate its low energy consumption, to  determine  the  equivalent  number  of  floating  operations  per  second  achievable compared to a computer on classification tasks.   Advised prerequisites   Knowledge of equations and dynamical systems. Courses in statistics, signal  processing  and  automation,  good  command  of  a  programming  language  (e.g. Matlab, Python, or C/C++).   Context  and  issue  modules:    These  modules  include  an  introductory  conference on the theme by personalities from the academic and industrial  worlds,  presentations  on  the  technological  and  scientific  obstacles,  and  a  presentation of the associated projects.   620      Specific course (60 HEE) : Optimization for learning physical systems   Short description: This course presents the physical and mathematical tools  for  the  realization  and  training  of  artificial  neural  networks:  echo  state  network  (ESN),  electronic  and  photonic  implementations,  memory  and  computational  capacity  of  physical  architectures,  supervised  and  unsupervised  learning,  ridge  regression  and  regularization,  accelerated  gradient descent techniques, heuristic methods, hardware approaches for  deep  networks,  emerging  technologies  (e.g.  integrated  photonics,  nanophotonics and spintronics)   Project: High performance and low energy cost classification of video signals  and images by photonic systems   - Associated partners: Start-up Light On, CentraleSupélec / Photonics Chair  and FEMTO-ST Institute   - Location: Metz campus   - Short description : The project will focus on the learning/optimization of  an experimental photonic architecture of a neuro-inspired analog computer  (developed  in  CentraleSupélec  laboratories  in  collaboration  with  the  FEMTO-ST  Institute).  Students  will  have  to  choose  learning/optimization  strategies  from  the  course  and  implement  them  so  that  the  photonic  architecture  can  perform  image/video  signal  classification  or  solve  industrially oriented problems proposed by our industrial partner Light-On.  The organization of the project is as follows:   1) Rapid bibliographical study of the image or video signal classification task  (or task proposed by the Light-On partner)   2) Numerical simulation on a realistic model of the architecture (provided)  under Matlab.  Implementation  of  learning  methods based  on  linear/ridge  regression, multi-logistic regression, or stochastic heuristics (unknown cost  function model).   3)  Identification  of  important  physical  hyper-parameters  (experimentally  adjustable) for the photonic architecture   tests,  performance  analysis,  evaluation  of   4)  Experimental  the  computational  capacity  (flops)  and  comparative  study  of  the  energy  performance (energy cost per processed image/video sequence) compared  to software methods.        621
