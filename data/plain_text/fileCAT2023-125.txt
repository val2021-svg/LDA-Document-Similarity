   2SC5591 - Synchrotron Beamline design       Instructors: Pierre-Eymeric Janolin  Department: DOMINANTE - PHYSIQUE ET NANOTECHNOLOGIES  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 40  On-site hours (HPE): 27,00        Description  This is a multidisciplinary course. Teams of about 20 students are challenged  with understanding, designing and scaling the physical, mechanical, heating  and  materials  aspects  of  key  technological  components  of  a  synchrotron  beamline.   This is a multidisciplinary course. Teams of about 20 students are challenged  with understanding, designing and scaling the physical, mechanical, heating  and  materials  aspects  of  key  technological  components  of  a  synchrotron  beamline. The use of CAD tools is encouraged.   Each team shall be supported by experts working in French and European  synchrotrons, through daily video interviews.   One of the team shall design a beamline able to perform angiography on a  human patient and the other team shall design a beamline able to detect  the  presence  of  a  cancer-inducing  isotope  of  Chromium  in  a  frog  ovarian  cells.        Quarter number  ST5     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  Basic knowledge in modern physics and heat transfer. Mechanical  engineering skills will be useful     Syllabus    This module is a project-based learning activity, with emphasis on the  following topics:   •  Crystallography, radiation by an accelerated particule, fluorescence,   absorption, scattering, diffraction of short wavelength radiation  •  Heat transfer: convection, radiation, conduction, fluid mechanics  •  Computer-Aided Design (CAD), numerical modeling, design pre project, pre-scaling of mechanical systems.   407      •  Selection of materials, standard mechanical properties, strength of   materials in an extreme environment, surface states, elaboration  and shaping processes   Experiencing teamwork under time pressure, chairing a meeting, oral  expression     Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)     Students will work in project mode during the one-week module and will  attend preparation and debrief sessions on prior and subsequent weeks.    The students enrolled in this course must attend the final defense, at  synchrotron SOLEIL; it is followed by a visit of the SOLEIL facility.       Grading    1/2 on the involvement during the week (evaluated by the profs as well as  the other team members) and evaluation of the C1, C2, C4, C6 skills   1/4 on the final presentation (one presenter per group, everybody in the  group gets the same grade) and evaluation of the C7 skill  1/4 on the final report (common grade for the entire team) and evaluation  of the C7 skill       Course support, bibliography    Reference textbooks and databases. ShareDoc (asynchroneous  collaborative platform), Adobe Connect (video-conferencing and  synchroneous collaborative work platform), Spaceclaim (CAD) and Comsol  (heat transfer).     Resources    The use of CAD tools (e.g. SPACECLAIM or SOLIDWORKS) is encouraged.  Students who wish to learn these tools will be given access to a license of  SPACECLAIM and will be provided with online tutorial sessions. Alternate  design tools (drawings, models,...) are also very useful, in particular for the  design of specific components of the beamline.     Learning outcomes covered on the course    •  apply design concepts using basic notions of modern physics  •  identify the key heat transfer modes to model and design systems.   •  know the key points for a pre-project study in a multidisciplinary   Use Comsol.   context   408      •  master the use of Ashby diagrams for materials selection  •  understand orders of magnitude for mechanical and physical   properties of usual materials   •  develop teamwork abilities, know and identify different roles in a   team (on the basis of Belbin tools); manage a workgroup, collect and  share information, shape and defend the results of the work in front  of an audience / a jury.        Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course   C1 : Analyze, design, and build complex systems with  scientific, technological, human, and economic components  C2 : Develop in-depth skills in an engineering field and a family of professions  C4 : Have a sense of value creation for his company and his customers  C6 : Be operational, responsible, and innovative in the digital world  C7 : Know how to convince   409
