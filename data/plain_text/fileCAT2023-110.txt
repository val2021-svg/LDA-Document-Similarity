   2SC5192 - Definition and design of a launcher mission       Instructors: Sihem Tebbani  Department: DOMINANTE - CONSTRUCTION VILLE TRANSPORTS, DOMINANTE -  GRANDS SYSTÈMES EN INTERACTION  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 40  On-site hours (HPE): 27,00        Description   In  this  challenge  week,  the  student  will  experiment  the  multidisciplinary  sizing and design of a launcher.   It  consists  in  the  understanding  the  interactions  between  the  different  technical fields involved in this design.  Another  issue  is  also  to  understand  the  associated  challenges  of  each  involved  technical  field  and  adopt  the  different  sizing  methods  for  a  first  sizing procedure.   For  this  propose,  the  challeng  week  is  organized  in  several  modules  of  a  realistic  sizing  loop  for  which  students  will  be  supported  by  CNES  DLA  engineers.      Quarter number  ST5     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  The course "Guidance and control of a launcher" of the specific course  "performance and flight trajectories".     Syllabus  This Challenge Week will be structured around the following modules:    •      Mission analysis - launcher staging  •      Trajectory  •      Liquid propulsion  •      Solid Propulsion  •      Aerodynamics and mechanical loads  •      Sizing of structures  •      Launcher control   Each module will be the subject of a dedicated session (half a day per  module) during which the students, working in pairs, will design and  consolidate a launcher ,meeting specific specifications.    360        Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)   Engineers from CNES DLA will supervise this Challenge Week.  They will provide a detailed work plan with questions to the students in  order to help them to make design choices while ensuring a good  understanding of the challenges (technical, programmatic) and the related  physical problems.   Analytical and numerical tools should be used by students to address the  issues raised.   The hypotheses and data considered should be questioned in order to  understand the issues of a multi-disciplinary design loop; these elements  will lead students to iterate on their design choices in order to obtain  relevant technical solutions.       Grading  The evaluation will include a final report, project progress notes at the end  of each module, and an oral presentation.
