         ST7 - 78 - ENERGY TRANSITION IN ISOLATED SITES     Dominante : GSI (Large Interacting Systems), ENE (Energy)  Langue d’enseignement : English  Campus où le cours est proposé : Rennes        Engineering problem   This topic focuses on the problems associated with a transition to a more  just and sustainable world in terms of access to energy. Indeed, some sites,  houses  or  others,  are  not  and  cannot  be  connected  to  the  distribution  network because of the technical complexity of connection and extension of  the network or because the cost of such an operation is either not justified  or is not feasible for areas located in poor regions of the world. It is therefore  necessary  to  propose  solutions  based  on  the  development  of  microgrids.  Microgrids allow the local deployment of small-scale collective installations  thanks to hybrid systems with decentralized production and storage as well  as intelligent management of production, storage and demand for each user.   The  deployment  of  microgrids  requires  a  system  approach  where  the  following questions arise:   - how to manage a multi-component system subject to different constraints,    -  how  to  manage  and  take  into  account  the  multiplicity  of  stakeholders:  users, communities, financiers, standards, etc.   -  how  to  manage  the  trade-off  between  economic  cost,  environmental  impact on life cycle, and quality of service.    Throughout  the  thematic  sequence  (context  and  issues  modules,  specific  course, project) students will address these issues. They will be interested in  defining  the  need  for  a  given  situation,  in  modeling  and  formalizing  the  optimization  problem.  They  will  be  led  to  propose  technically  and  economically reliable solutions in an uncertain environment.   Advised prerequisites   Modeling, Probability/Statistics course   Context and issue modules: These modules include an introductory lecture  on the theme, presentations on the technological and scientific challenges,  and a presentation of the associated projects.   577         Specific course (60 HEE) : Renewable energies and microgrids   Brief  description  :  Faced  with  the  negative  environmental  impacts  of  all  energy  production  and  the  depletion  of  fossil  resources,  the  transition  to  renewable sources is a fundamental trend. While renewables provided only  25% of global electricity production in 2018, this share is growing rapidly,  with wind and solar tripling over 10 years.   These  new  energies  raise  specific  questions  that  this  course  proposes  to  address:   - what are the wind and solar energy sources and the main principles of their  conversion into electricity?   -  What  are  the  storage  technologies,  in  particular  batteries,  capable  of  handling the variability of these sources?   - What are the technical, environmental and economic challenges of these  technologies?   Moreover, wind and solar power are much more decentralized sources than  traditional thermal power plants. Thus, the production of electricity is closer  to the places of consumption, which gives rise to the notion of "microgrid",  analogous to the short circuits in agriculture.   A  microgrid  is  a  small  electrical  system  that  integrates  production  and  consumption in a defined area (building, district, island, etc.) and is equipped  with local management of energy flows. A microgrid can be autonomous or  connected  to  a  large  network.  If  it  is  connected,  it  behaves  as  a  single,  intelligent  player,  capable,  for  example,  of  buying  electricity  from  the  wholesale  market  at  the  best  times  or  providing  network  services.  The  integration  of  all  these  components  and  functions  poses  system  optimization questions addressed in this course.   Due to their small size, reliability is an important issue for microgrids. This  course proposes to study the methods of dependability to analyze the risks  of failure, plan maintenance and react to failures...   Project: Decarbonized island microgrid   - Associated partner:    - Location: Rennes campus   578      -  Brief  description  :  Nearly  one  billion  people  still  do  not  have  access  to  electricity (IEA 2018). These populations are often in remote areas in rural  or island regions. Thus, for 3/4 of them, it is not economically efficient to  bring  electricity  to  them  by  expanding  existing  large-scale  power  grids.  Electrification  must  therefore  be  done  on  a  local  scale,  through  what  are  known as microgrids.   The generation of electricity in a microgrid can be done by fossil fuels (diesel  generators)  or  by  renewable  energies  (solar  panels...).  Thanks  to  technological  progress,  the  latter  are  generally  less  expensive.  However,  their  intermittency  pushes  to  complete  them  by  more  expensive  but  controllable means (Diesel, battery storage, hydrogen...). The size of each of  the components of a microgrid (called its "dimensioning") must therefore be  optimized according to various criteria: economic cost, of course, but also  quality of service, energy independence or greenhouse gas emissions. The  management  of  energy  flows  (e.g.:  arbitration  between  diesel  and  battery/hydrogen) is also to be optimized. This project proposes to address  these different optimization issues on the concrete case of isolated sites.      579
