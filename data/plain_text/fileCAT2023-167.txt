   ST7 - 73 - CIRCULAR ECONOMY AND INDUSTRIAL   SYSTEMS     Dominante : GSI (Large Interacting Systems), VSE (Living-Health-Environment), CVT  (Construction, City and Transport)  Langue d’enseignement : French  Campus où le cours est proposé : Paris-Saclay        Engineering problem   Companies are becoming actors in the transition to a more environmentally  friendly economy. For example, several of them called for a strong agreement  at  COP21  and  since  then  more  and  more  of  them  are  deciding  to  act  and  transform their  practices  towards  more  "circular"  models. This new way of  doing business translates into action several mutually reinforcing factors: the  growing awareness of the challenges of the ecological and energy transition,  the multiplication of initiatives on a territorial scale, the strengthening of laws  and  standards  towards  a  more  sustainable  economy,  and  market  balances  that are changing and making sustainable practices more profitable.   The  circular  economy  aims  to  move  away  from  a  culture  of  extraction  and  waste and to optimize the use of resources to minimize the impact of human  activities  on  the  environment.  Industrial  ecology  is  a  scientific  approach  to  integrated  metabolism  that  makes  it  possible  to  implement  this  circular  economy, via - among other things - industrial synergies (pooling of material,  water or energy flows between companies), the eco-design of products and  services, or the economy of functionality.   It  is  a  formidable  field  of  innovation,  commercial  differentiation  and  a  sustainable  and  profitable  growth  relay  that  is  emerging.  This  circular  economy needs leaders capable of understanding the issues at stake, trained  to  initiate  and  manage  ambitious  projects  at  the  level  of  companies  and  territories.   This  Engineering  Challenge  Term  (Séquence  Thématique)  tackles  in  detail  Circular  Economy  through  engineering  strategies,  methods  and  tools  that  allow its implementation (thus this is not an economy course). It alternates  between  theory  (course),  application  (tutorial  classes,  academic  project,  industrial  project),  and  activities  by  industrial  or  institutional  partners  (conferences, workshops, industrial project).      None   Advised prerequisites   514            Context  and  issue  modules:  The  introduction  of  the  sequence  is  organized  around three half-days aiming at presenting the sequence, the projects and  introducing the issues of the Circular Economy, with the following activities:   Introductory conferences and round table: introduction to Circular Economy  by field actors (National Institute of Circular Economy, Law firm specialized in  Circular Economy)   Discovery  workshops:  workshop  "Impacts  of  the  Smartphone"  (example  of  the  Fairphone),  workshop  "Circular  business  models"  (example  of  the  SEB  company),  workshop  "Reuse  and  repair  strategies"  (example  of  recycling  centers)   If  possible,  site  visits  (e.g.  Paris-Saclay  heating  and  cooling  network),  or  industrial conferences.   Specific course (60 HEE) : Circular Economy and Industrial Ecology Methods   Brief description: The course aims to go through the different dimensions of  the Circular Economy to give students an overview of the field. Then the focus  will be on the operational tools of Industrial Ecology that students will learn  to manipulate (MFA and LCA software) to carry out an "academic" Industrial  Ecology  project  by  modeling  material  and  energy  flows  and  by  measuring  environmental impacts. These tools can be used in the industrial project of  the thematic sequence.   Projects:   The sequence is built around an industrial project; 2 to 4 topics in connection  with industrial partners will be proposed to students, including at least one  project  carried  by  the  VSE  major  and  one  by  the  CVT  major.  The  topics  described  below  are  those  of  past  years  and  are  provided  for  information  purposes only. Those of 2022 will be on similar topics.   Project #1 (example 2020 to 2022) : Biorefinery : optimization of flows and/or  associated processes   - Industrial Partner : Chair of Biotechnology, ARD   - Location : Paris-Saclay + visit of the biorefinery of Pomacle (CEBB and partner  industrial site)   - Short description : The biorefinery can be defined as an industrial ecosystem  that  transforms  biomass  (agro  resources  and  animal  waste)  into  several  products  from  alimentary  to  energy,  chemicals,  raw  materials,  cosmetics,   515         health…).  France  is  a  leading  country  in  this field  at the  international  level,  thanks to the biorefinery located in Pomacle Bazancourt, which treats more  than  4  Mt  of  biomass  per  year.  The  biorefinery  is,  therefore,  a  relevant  industrial tool to accompany the ecological transition, first to answer the issue  of climate change and second to help the industrial relocation, especially in  territories  of  agricultural  and  forestry  production.  The  biorefinery  also  contributes  actively  to  Sustainable  Development  (environment,  economy,  and social pillars). The project aims to map the different production units and  characterize and quantify the inputs and outputs streams. Second, from this  exploration phase, the goal is to propose new stream exchange architecture  to  optimize  the  environmental  footprint  of  the  biorefinery.  The  proposed  approach  science,  modelingsimulationoptimization, process engineering, and industrial engineering. The  students  are  expected  to  work  in  a  group  to  identify,  develop  and  present  operational  solutions  that  reduce  the  environmental  impact  of  the  biorefinery.   is  multidisciplinary  and  mixes  data   Project #2 (example 2021) : ESA_Lab@CentraleSupélec   - Industrial Partner : Agence Spatiale Européenne (ESA)   - Location : Campus Paris-Saclay   in  2020,   -  Short  description  :  the  MELiSSA  project  of  ESA  aims  at  developing  a  regenerative support life system to reproduce the main function of the Earth  ecosystem (water and oxygen production), in a limited mass and volume and  with an exterme security. MELiSSA is on of the most accomplished Circular  Economy  example  in  the  world,  considering  loops  of  material  and  energy  flows.  ESA_Lab@CentraleSupélec,  created  is  a  privileged  collaboration framework between ESA and CentraleSupélec. Its objective is to  develop the interest and knowledge of peaceful space exploration activities,  and  associated  transverse  applications,  like  climate  observation,  Earth  observation, navigation, (cyber)security, artificial intelligence, sustainability,  spatial  economy...,  to  the  mutual  benefit  of  the  two  organizations  and  the  Society. This ST7 projects aims at specifying and proposing first scenarios of  the preliminary design of a future "demonstration lab", that will be a place of  scientific experiments and projects around Circular Economy and with close  links  with  MELiSSA.  The  project  is  structured  in  two  main  phases:  (1)  Specification  of  the  demonstration  lab:  needs  and  first  ideas  identification,  thanks  to  a  interviews  with  CentraleSupélec  stakeholders  and  ESA  experts;  (2)  Preliminary  design  of  the  demonstration  lab.   literature  review  and   516      Project #3 (example 2022) : Laptop reconditioning   - Industrial Partner : Emmaüs Connect   - Location : Campus Paris-Saclay + visit of a laptop reconditioning center   - Short description : Member of Mouvement Emmaüs, Emmaüs Connect is a  French association created in 2013 to fight digital divide and digital illiteracy.  Emmaüs  Connect  launched  in  November  2020  LaCollecte.tech,  a  platform  that  allows  organizations  to  provide  a  second  life  to  their  unused  digital  devices to the benefit of people in social and digital insecurity. The project  aims at fostering laptop reconditionning for the 8 million of French citizens  who do not have access to the internet and thus to first need services (while  in the meantime, 33% of companies own dormant devices they are not able  to  value).  Four  axes  were  studied  (each  group  of  students  handled  two  of  them):  (1)  imagine  a  "universal"  shell  that  would  allow  to  recreate  a  new  second hand laptop with any resued component; (2) design a tool to assess  the  compatibility  of  laptop  components  from  different  brands,  different  models  and  based  on  available  stocks;  (3)  study  the  feasibility  of  a  laptop  whose motherboard would be a Raspberry Pi (because laptop's motherboards  are  very  hard  to  reuse  as  components  are  very  often  welded);  (4)  propose  advocacy  measures  for  laptop  manufacturers  to  promote  the  evolution  of  their industrial practices towards more circularity and sustainability.   Project #4 (example 2022) : Circolab student trophy   - Industrial Partner : association professionnelle Circolab   -  Location  :  Campus  Paris-Saclay  +  visit  of  the  building  site  of  the  olympic  village (Saint-Denis   -  Short  description  :  Circolab  is  a  professional  association  of  organizations  from the real estate and building sector aiming at promoting circular economy  in  their  activities.  Circolab  launched  in  2022  the  very  first  edition  of  the  Circular Economy Trophy intended for engineering and architecture students,  including  CentraleSupélec.  Several  case  studies  were  proposed  to  students  with a common objective: propose realistic and quantified circular economy  initiatives at the scale of a building or a city district. The ST7 students worked  on two case studies associated with the futur athletes' village for the Olympic  Games  in  Paris  in  2024:  (1)  A  case  proposed  by  SOLIDEO  (organization  in  charge of  the  construction of  olympic  works)  at  the  scale of  a  city block  to  imagine solutions for circularizing water flows; (2) A case proposed by Vinci at  the  scale  of  another  city  block  to  imagine  solutions  to  maximize  the  valorization  of  equipments  (partition  walls,  furniture,  bathrooms)  between  the phase "Games" (= during the games) and the phase "Legacy" (= after the  games, when the village will become a housing, offices and shops district).   517
