   2SC8191 - Optimization of aeronautical parts in metal   additive manufacturing       Instructors: Camille Gandiolle, Andrea Barbarulo  Department: DOMINANTE - CONSTRUCTION VILLE TRANSPORTS  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 80  On-site hours (HPE): 48,00          Description   Project to respond to a problem proposed by a partner from the aerospace  industry around the optimization of the design of a part in metal additive  manufacturing.     Quarter number  ST7     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)   To have completed the “continuum mechanic” SPI course and at least one  of the following courses: Materials, Transport phenomena,  Thermodynamics.       Syllabus  Students are divided into teams of 5 maximum. Each team must optimize  the design of a metal part subjected to complex mechanical and/or thermal  loads, or even multiphysics. This may involve optimizing its geometry,  thinking about its design, designing a system for a given use, analyzing the  performance of a part already designed by additive manufacturing... This  work must take into account the specific capabilities and restrictions of the  additive manufacturing process.    step 1: Getting to know the subject  step 2 : Simplified representation of the studied part to reach a first  optimum on a first field of parameters.  step 3 : Optimization of the system in a new parameter space closer to the  real system modeled by advanced methods.  step 4 : Analysis of the cost benefits of the proposed solution compared to  the classical solution, e.g. manufacturing time, cost of materials, labor  employed, environmental compatibility...   614        Most topics involve finite element simulation on COMSOL or the software  of the students' choice. Some topics may involve experimental work.      Grading   C2 and C8 skills will be evaluated throughout the project, which will end  with a defense in the presence of the industrial partner. Competencies C2  and C7 will be evaluated during the defense. The partner will evaluate the  C4 competence.  Continuous assessment during the project (C2, C8) : N1  Teachers' grade for the oral defense (C2, C7) : N2  Industrial partners' mark (C2, C4, C7) : N3  NF = 30%N1 +30%N2 + 40%N3        Resources  COMSOL and the school's software and experimental resources      Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course  C2 Develop in-depth skills in an engineering field and a family of  professions  C4 Have a sense of value creation for his company and his customers  C7 Know how to convince  C8 Lead a project, a team  615
