   2SC6010 - Autonomous Robotics       Instructors: Jeremy Fix  Department: CAMPUS DE METZ  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE METZ  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 34,50        Description  This course will present the field of autonomous robotics (vehicle driving,  exploration and inspection robots, etc.) by showing how this problem  integrates very diverse technologies (localisation (SLAM), point clouds,  planning, pattern recognition) and how this integration is achieved at the  system level (illustrations with ROS). The laboratory works associated with  the course will be carried out on the Turtlebots mobile robots available in  the smartroom of the Metz campus. This work will be an opportunity to  integrate different techniques of machine learning and signal processing on  robots moving in their environment by progressively building a system  allowing a manual control but also a mapping and an autonomous  navigation in an unknown environment.      Quarter number  ST5     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)   1C1000 : Information systems and programming  1C4000 : Signal processing    Knowledge in probability theory will be helpful. Python programming  practice is a definitive advantage.       Syllabus   - Lecture 1 (1h30) : Introduction to autonomous robotics  - Lecture 2 (1h30) : Introduction to ROS and simulation, experiment on real  robot  - Introductory Lab (6h00) : Simulator, ROS and ROS advanced  - Lecture 3 (1h30) : Primer on Bayesian inference  - Lecture 4 (1h30) : State estimation  - Tutorial1 (1h30) : Kalman Filter and state estimation  - Lab2 (1h30) : Kalman Filter and state estimation   465      - Lecture 5 (1h30) : Localization  - Tutorial2 (1h30) : Localization (Markov and Monte Carlo)  - Lab3 (3h00) : Localization (Markov and Monte Carlo)  - Lecture 6 (1h30) : Mapping and SLAM  - Lab4 (3h00) : Mapping and SLAM  - Lecture 7 (1h30) : Motion planning  - Lab 5 (3h00) : Deterministic and stochastic planning  - Lecture 8 (1h30) : Navigation  - Lab 6 (3h00) : Trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance  - Lecture 9 (1h30) : Architecture and interaction   - Lab 7 (3h00) : Integration on a real robot    Total:  Lectures : 13.5 HPE  Tutorials : 3 HPE  Introductory Lab : 6 HPE  Lab works: 16.5 HPE       Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)  The course is organized around lectures complemented with tutorials and  lab works for practicing the concepts. The lab works, with real or simulated  robotic  platforms,  will  specifically  be  the  opportunity  to  implement  the  various  concepts  seen  in  the  class.  In  order  for  the  practicals  to  be  as  profitable as possible, they will be prepared in advance by the students with  the help of a worksheet that will be sent to them. This implementation will  heavily rely on ROS, which will be presented in details at the beginning of  the course. Programming will be done in Python and all the experiments will  run on Linux.
