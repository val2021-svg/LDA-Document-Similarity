   2EL2020 - Physics of divided matter       Instructors: Hervé Duval  Department: DÉPARTEMENT MÉCANIQUE ENERGÉTIQUE PROCÉDÉS  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Engineering Sciences  Advanced level : Yes      Description   “God made solids, but surfaces were the work of the devil” (Wolfgang Pauli)  The  behavior  of  dispersed  media  such  as  bubbles,  drops,  liquid  films  or  colloids is strongly influenced by capillary and surface forces. Correlatively,  body forces such as gravity play a secondary role. The present course focuses  on dispersed systems with characteristic size ranging from 1 mm down to 10  nm.  These  systems  can  be  found  everywhere  around  us.  Applications  concern  biology  (super-hydrophobic  leaves,  surfactant  film  in  lungs,  cavitation  bubble  made  by  a  pistol  shrimp),  environmental  science  (dynamics  of  raindrops  and  their  role  in the biosphere,  sediment  siltation  in  estuaries),  technology  (fabrication  of  cosmetic  and  pharmaceutical  emulsions,  food  industry, fire-fighting or insulating foams, surface treatments, lab-on-a-chip)  and daily life (tears of wine, rising humidity and deterioration of houses and  historical stone monuments). Numerous industrial innovations are based on  the implementation and control of these systems.  The present course introduces the basic concepts of the physics of surfaces  and  addresses  various  interfacial  phenomena  encountered  in  dispersed  systems: capillarity and wetting, colloidal interactions and Brownian motion,  interface dynamics and associated instabilities. The role of interfacial energy  in phase transformations (nucleation step) will be also discussed.      Quarter number  SG8     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  Transport phenomena (recommended)     Syllabus     The course is divided into three parts: 12 hours of lectures and related  tutorials, 12 hours devoted to case studies, 11 hours dedicated to the  realization of a miniproject.   161         Basic concepts (4 x (1.5h lecture + 1.5h tutorials))     1) Notion of surface tension  Physical origin  The thermodynamic and mechanical points of view  Capillarity: Laplace's law  Interfaces and boundary conditions of the Navier-Stokes equations  Area minimisation and minimum surfaces  Tutorial #1: Liquid menisci, capillary forces, wet hair and insects on water    2) Wetting   Ideal solid surfaces: Young-Dupré's law  Contact angle hysteresis  Influence of surface roughness  Influence of chemical heterogeneities  Towards superhydrophobic surfaces  Contact line dynamics  Tutorial #2: Modeling equilibrium contact angles on textured surfaces    3) Surfactants: equilibrium and dynamics  Amphiphilic molecules  Surface concentration and Gibbs adsorption equation  Micelles and critical micellar concentration  Dynamic surface tension and dynamics of surfactants  Interfacial rheology  Tutorial #3: Formation and drainage of a soap film    4) Colloidal scale  Colloids and colloidal systems  Brownian movement and Brownian limit  Interaction forces between surfaces: van der Waals force, osmotic pressure  effects  DLVO Theory - Why do estuaries silt up?  Thin liquid films and disjunction pressure  Tutorial #4: Evaporation in a microchannel     Case studies (4 x 3h)     Each case study offers the opportunity to examine physical phenomena of  industrial or practical interest, to apply the concepts introduced in the  lectures and to become familiar with state of the art modelling methods  and mathematical tools. The case studies are carried out by groups of 3 to  4 students and supervised by a teacher. The duration of 3 hours per study  allows each group to get to grips with the subject and to work on its own,  with the methodological support of its supervisor. At the end of the 3   162      hours, each group reports its work in a note (handwritten or by word  processing, as desired).    5) Capillary rise and imbibition  Applications: from raw sap rising in trees to the manufacture of composite  materials  Equilibrium height in a vertical tube  Dynamics of capillary rise: inertial and viscous regimes  Capillary rise in a corner    6) Drainage and deposition of liquid films on a vertical flat plate  From anti-corrosion coatings on steel sheets to anti-reflective coatings on  eyeglass lenses  Drainage of a liquid film  Dip coating  Scaling  Landau-Levich-Derjaguin theory: dynamic meniscus and asymptotic  matching    7) Drop spreading  From coatings, inkjet printing to criminal investigations  Dynamic contact angle and contact line speed  Case of the perfect wetting: Tanner's Law  Influence of impact velocity on the maximum spreading diameter  The different impact regimes    8) Techniques to measure surface tension  This case study includes a practical work. It is carried out at the Laboratoire  de Génie des Procédés et Matériaux (EIFFEL building, Univers Vivant). Two  techniques for measuring surface tension are implemented and analysed in  depth:  - The drop weight method (or stalagmometry)  - The pendant drop method.     Miniproject (9h+2h)     The mini-project is carried out in groups of 3 to 4 students. Each  miniproject is part of a theme (related to the physics of divided matter)  and focuses on a specific phenomenon, system or object. The student  apply and deepen the various concepts previously discussed in class but  also explore other aspects of the physics of divided matter. As an example,  for the academic year 2019-2020, the themes chosen by the students  were: The ascent of sap in trees, Surface phenomena used by carnivorous  plants, Marangoni busrting, The cavitation bubble of the snapping shrimp.  Starting from the selected theme, each group has to    - address an issue,    163      - carry out and present a “kitchen experiment” to illustrate the theme  and/or the problem  - identify the physical mechanisms involved in the focused problem  - optionally: design an experiment to investigate the problem, carry out a  test campaign, analyze the experimental results and propose a simple  model that accounts for the results OR develop a more complex model,  implement it on the computer, run a parametric study and discuss the  results.    The deliverables are :  - A ppt file that reports on the work done (the support of the oral  presentation + appendices detailing the experiments, calculations, list of  bibliographical references)  - A 20 min oral presentation with a demonstration of the code or a movie  of the running experimental set-up, followed by 10 min of questions  (duration adjusted for the number of groups)       Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)    The course is divided into three parts (see Contents for more details): 12  hours of lectures and related tutorials, 12 hours devoted to case studies  (including 3 hours of practical work), 11 hours dedicated to the realization  of a miniproject.
