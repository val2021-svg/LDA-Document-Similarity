   SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING   CHALLENGE N°5 COURSES                                                   349      ST5 - 51 - PILOTING AND FLIGHT CONTROL IN  AERONAUTICS AND SPACE TRANSPORTATION     Dominante : GSI (Large Interacting Systems) and CVT (Construction, City and Transport)  Langue d’enseignement : French  Campus où le cours est proposé : Paris-Saclay        Engineering problem   This sequence addresses the problem of designing flight control laws and dynamic  control of vehicle flight (aircraft, satellite and launcher). It aims to give students the  basic  concepts  associated  with  the  design  of  control  systems  of  a  flying  object  around its 6 degrees of freedom in order to ensure stability of operation and the  required  performance.  The  technologies  in  the  fields  of  aeronautics  and  space  being  in  constant  evolution  (propulsion,  structure,  materials,  etc.),  the  laws  of  piloting must adapt to guarantee the best performances while taking into account  the new constraints, in particular regulatory, environmental and economic.   The integration course allows students to apply the skills and knowledge acquired  in the case of an aircraft, a nanosatellite and/or a launcher. These vehicles have  become very popular in recent years due to the reduced cost associated with their  construction and operation. However, it raises new problems, in particular for the  control of attitude and performance due to the miniaturization of the components  and thus the reduction of their capacities of action and their effectiveness.   The  intervention  of  industrialists  from  the  aeronautics  and  space  sector  in  this  sequence allows a better understanding of the issues associated with the design  and operation of increasingly constrained systems.   Adviced prerequisites   Two main topics are covered in this sequence: modeling of undeformable objects  and  modeling  of  linear  systems  (transfer  functions,  state  representation,  differential equations) for control. These recommended prerequisites are part of  the  common  course  of  Modeling  (ST2)  and  the  SPI  course  of  Mechanics  and  Continuous Media. The rest of the necessary skills are based on the capitalization  of CPGE knowledge and self-training.   Context and issue modules:  The introduction of the sequence is organized around  four  half-days  of  training  aiming  at  presenting  the  sequence,  the  integration  teaching and introducing the stakes of the various sectors of space and aeronautics,  according to the actions:   Presentation of the thematic sequence and introduction to the integration   1.  lessons   2.

Specific course (60 HEE) : Performance and flight trajectories   Brief description : The objectives of this specific course are to:   - model the behavior of a vehicle in flight in the framework of rigid body mechanics,    -  describe  the  dynamics  of  vehicles  in  the  case  of  flights  in  and  out  of  the  atmosphere (trajectory, eigenmodes, instabilities)   - choose and deploy control and piloting strategies.    It is organized in two steps. First, based on the mechanics course offered in the first  year, the mechanics of rigid bodies is introduced to give the necessary tools for the  construction  of  models  of  aircraft,  launchers,  satellites,  UAVs...  For  this,  two  courses will give the basic concepts of flight mechanics and space mechanics. In a  second phase, the course will describe the dynamics and control strategies of an  aircraft, a satellite and a launcher. These three  phases of the course  will involve  several actors from the aeronautics and space sectors. The sessions will provide an  understanding  of  the  models  used  and  the  control  strategies  to  be  used.  The  students will take control tools on a specific system and will be able to set up a  control strategy in a pre-project phase during the integration teaching.   Challenge Week :    Preamble: The three integration courses are built in the same way and cover the  same learning objectives. The aim is to start from a performance specification for  an  aircraft,  a  nanosatellite  or  a  launcher  and  to  make  architecture  and  piloting  choices  to  ensure  the  expected  performance.  The  common  objectives  are  therefore:   - Understand the constraints of flying systems, and the different levels of modeling  of dynamic behavior   - Choose the relevant technical solutions for the control of trajectory, stability and  orientation (sensors/actuators...)   - Design a complete system by modeling, including actuators and sensors, actuator  sizing, power generation and CPU capacity   - Implementation of an optimal control law, taking into account economic aspects   351         - Validation of the control law on a realistic model   Challenge week n°1 : Control strategy for a nanosatellite   - Associated partner: Thalès Alenia Space via the CentraleSupélec Space Center   - Location: Paris-Saclay campus   - Brief description: This integration course will be conducted in collaboration with  Thalès  Alenia  Space.  The  objective  is  to  design  a  nanosatellite  (Cubesat).  For  a  specific  mission  defined  by  a  specification,  participants  will  propose  an  orbit,  choose  the  satellite  components,  design  the  operating  modes  and  develop  a  control law.   Challenge week n°2: Definition and design of a launcher mission   - Associated partner: CNES Direction des Lanceurs   - Location: Paris-Saclay campus   - Brief description : The objective of this integration course is to bring the students,  through  a  space  launcher  design  project,  to  experience  a  multi-disciplinary  dimensioning loop. To this end, the project is articulated in modules reflecting the  unfolding  of  a  design  loop,  with  CNES  DLA  (Direction  des  Lanceurs)  engineers  accompanying the students during each of these modules.   Challenge Week n°3: Aircraft design   - Associated partner: Dassault Aviation   - Location: Paris-Saclay campus   - Brief description: The objective of this challenge week is to discover the different  stages of the design process of a business aircraft, both from a theoretical and a  practical  point  of  view.  The  study  will  focus  on  the  design  of  the  aircraft  and  improvement of its performance, the development of a control law, and the risk  analysis and certification associated with the developed solution.   352
