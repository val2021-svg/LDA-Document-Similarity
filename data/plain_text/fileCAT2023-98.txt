   2EL6120 - Intelligent Wireless Access & Experimentation      Instructors: Georgios Ropokis  Department: CAMPUS DE RENNES  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE RENNES  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Engineering Sciences  Advanced level : Yes        Description   The scope of the course is to present the essential knowledge necessary to  understand  the  characteristics  of  wireless  communications  systems  and  standards. To this end, the course focuses on some of the several aspects of  communications systems including:   1.  transmission technologies used in current and future standards,   including 4G and 5G   2.  Multiple Access technologies used in current and future standards   (starting from 2G and moving to 5G and beyond 5G),   3.  the basics and characteristics of telecommunications hardware   including the architecture of computing equipment used in  communication and the behavior of RF chains,   4.  architectures of mobile processors  5.  the process of experimentation and prototyping for wireless   communications systems.   The course covers all the technical essentials for students that are interested  in  understanding  the  fundamentals  of  wireless  communications  and  its  applications,  and  can  serve  as  a  first  step  for  those  interested  in  taking  further studies in wireless communications engineering. Moreover, as the  course  exposes  students  to  several  aspects  of  wireless  communications  engineering,  it  serves  as  an  excellent  opportunity  for  those  of  them  interested in pursuing a career in project/team management in the broad  area  of  Communications  Engineering.  The  course  will  help  students  familiarising  with  the  most  significant  aspects  of  Wireless  engineering  including  wireless  communications  standards  and  their  characteristics,  wireless  hardware  and  prototyping.  The  presentation  of  the  material  will  follow a standard oriented approach such as to cover students interested  both in the fundamentals of Wireless Communications as well as students  mostly interested in a more applied approach to Wireless Communications.        317      Quarter number  SG8     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)     •  Notions of probabilities  •  Digital Signal Processing (Fourier Transform, Spectral Analysis)  •  Basic programming skills   These presrequisites correspond to signal processing  (1CC4000),modelisation (1CC3000) and programming (1CC1000) courses.
