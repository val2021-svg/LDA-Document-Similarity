   2SC5793 - Design of a coating : Control of   electromagnetic pollution       Instructors: Anna Rozanova-Pierrat  Department: DOMINANTE - MATHÉMATIQUES, DATA SCIENCES  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 40  On-site hours (HPE): 27,00          Description  We  are  positioning  ourselves  on  the  industrial  stakes  which  impose  the  economic  constraints  and  the  technological  constraints  necessary  to  improve  the  existing  products  of  the  market,  this  in  order  to  absorb  the  electromagnetic  waves.  As  fields  of  application,  we  aim  at  the  design  /  optimization  of  electromagnetic  anechoic  chambers.  It  is  noted  that  the  absorbent materials (there will be an anechoic chamber visit in the Bréguet  building and eventially of Thales-Limours) for the electromagnetic waves are  different dissipative materials for acoustic waves.     Quarter number  ST5     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  The course "Engineering of waves" of the 1st year will be a plus.      The courses of ST5 and in particular the course "Theory and algorithmics  for wave control" (one of two proposed trackes).     Syllabus  Team work "company", definition of issues, bibliographic research, physical  understanding  and  practical  interest,  mathematical  modeling  of  the  problem,  development  of  the  corresponding  mathematical  theory  if  necessary  (the  problem  well  or  badly  posed,  regularity  of  the  solution  ,  derivation of the electromagnetic energy with respect to the geometry of  the  wall,  influence  of  the  choice  of  the  chosen  porous  material  on  the  absorption  of  the  energy,  ...),  development  /  implementation  of  the  numerical method, the numerical analysis of the results , the analysis of their  relevance, possible improvement,  obtaining  an  effective  form  for  a  broad  band of frequencies.    443      Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)  Teamwork, project, dialogue with various specialists in the field.     Grading  Report, final and intermediate deliverables, defense by team      Resources  Computer room    Students will perform modeling, simulation, visualization and rendering of  the chosen phenomenon. They will study the simulation chain with a goal  of performance and precision under economic constraints (manufacturing  cost) and environmental (gain in decibel or potential).    Deliverables: report, software, transparencies and defense       Learning outcomes covered on the course     -  Understand the contribution of geometry in the design and   development of new products   -  Understand the theoretical and numerical techniques of controlling   -   electromagnetic waves  Implement numerical methods to simulate phenomena of  propagation of large electromagnetic waves (problems for a wide  band of frequencies)   -  Validate the theoretical and numerical techniques of the control of   the electromagnetic waves   -  Confront students with the realization of a complex product by   numerical simulation techniques        Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course    C4, C6, C7        444
