   ST5 - 58 - COMPLEX INDUSTRIAL AND CRITICAL   SYSTEMS WITH DOMINANT SOFTWARE     Dominante : Info&Num (Computer and Digital)  Langue d’enseignement : Freench  Campus où le cours est proposé : Paris-Saclay        Engineering problem   This thematic sequence approaches an axis of software sciences through the  implementation  of  a  development  cycle  allowing  the  design  of  complex  industrial  and  critical  systems  where  software  is  preponderant.  Modern  industrial  systems  are  often  composed  of  heterogeneous  interacting  components that can be defined as complex systems (systems of systems).  What characterizes such systems is that they are often software dominated  (e.g. cyber-physical systems). Moreover, their behavior is often difficult to  apprehend  because  of  the  emergence  of  global  behaviors  that  cannot  be  anticipated at a more local level. Finally, they are critical in the sense that  the  slightest  design  error  can  have  crippling  consequences  on  the  global  behavior of the system.   More precisely, this thematic sequence aims at addressing both the design  and the verification of such complex and critical systems by using techniques  from  Software  Engineering.  As  the  components  of  such  systems  are  heterogeneous  (i.e.  both  physical  and  software),  the  methodologies  and  tools  presented  in  this  topic  will  be  multiple  and  will  be  integrated  in  a  development cycle. The idea is to start the analysis phase using semi-formal  tools (UML, SysML, ...), often used in systems engineering to describe the  structuring  of  the  system  and  its  interactions,  and  then  to  scientifically  approach  the  design  and  validation  phases  using  formal  techniques  of  Software  Engineering  (timed  and  hybrid  modeling, temporal  logic,  modelchecking) The interaction of the system with its external environment (which  can be the human user or not) is one of the main points that will be taken  into account.   The  main  objective  of  such  an  approach  is  to  show,  through  the  formal  models  obtained,  that  the  system  does  what  is  expected  of  it  while  respecting  the  constraints  imposed  by  the  specifications  and  by  the  environment, or in the opposite case, to extract the states of the system that  may call into question its proper functioning. In the latter case, the economic  gain  is  very  interesting  and  appreciable by the engineers who will  benefit  from  correcting  the  problems  detected  by  the  verification  of  the  model  before moving on to the implementation stage (programming).   445   Adviced prerequisites         None   Context  and  issue  modules:  This  part  is  structured  around  half-days  of  training  aimed  at  presenting  the  sequence,  the  integration  teaching  and  introducing the theme. Thus, conferences and round tables will be organized  on the current state of model-driven engineering in the industrial world and  the challenges for the future; or entitled "The application of Formal Methods  to Railway Signalling Software".   Specific course (60 HEE) : Design and verification of critical systems   Brief description: a critical system is a system whose failure can have serious  consequences,  such  as  transportation  systems  (trains,  planes,  cars  ...)  or  energy production systems (nuclear, wind ...). These systems are complex  and in order to guarantee their proper functioning, it is necessary to take  into account the continuous and event-driven aspects of their dynamics. A  part of the course will therefore be dedicated to the design and modeling of  critical and complex systems. In addition, their reliability is a major economic  and societal issue. Another part of the course will then be dedicated to the  methods and tools (formal or semi-formal) proposed to guarantee the safety  properties during the design phase.   Challenge week n°1: Design of a safe signalling system for railways   - Associated partner: Systerel   - Location: Paris-Saclay campus   Brief description: In a railway system, it is essential that the points do not  move when a train runs over them, otherwise there is a high risk of derailing.  To this end, a signaling system has signals (a bit like traffic lights on the road)  that  allow  to  ask  trains  to  stop  before  the  switches.  Things  get  more  complicated if the train is too close to the signal to stop (same problem as  an orange light for a car). The objective of this case study is to formally model  such a system and to show that it is safe: the trains will not derail.   Challenge week n°2: Design of intelligent systems for automated air traffic  control   - Associated partner: to be confirmed   - Location: Paris-Saclay campus   446      -  Brief  description:  Critical  information  systems  in  the  avionics  field  are  subject to very important time and reliability constraints. Their development  therefore  requires  engineering  techniques  that  take  these  characteristics  into account from the early phases of their life cycle. This AR focuses on the  design  of  models  of  intelligent  systems  to  control  air  traffic  and  the  verification  of  certain  safety  properties  on  these  models.  These  systems  implement  many  strongly  interacting  components,  which  are  parallel  and  asynchronous. All these subsystems are subject to verification and testing to  ensure their own functionality. For example, it is critical to demonstrate the  absence of deadlocks and the ability of each to operate correctly within their  own time constraints. It is also important to schedule the actions of these  subsystems  and  ensure  a  reliable  control  of  the  whole  system.  As  an  example,  some  important  properties  (formulated  in  STL)  to  check:  1)  Air  traffic  should  never  be  allowed  in  both  directions  simultaneously  on  the  same route 2) The aircraft must respond to messages within a limited time  3) For two aircraft, there must be a separation with a minimum distance.   Challenge  week  3:  Design  and  analysis  of  production  systems  for  smart  factories   - Associated partner: to be confirmed   - Location: Paris-Saclay campus   integrated   technologies  are   - Brief description: Industry 4.0 or "smart factories" are concepts that define  the fourth industrial revolution, which began at the beginning of the 21st  century  and  continues  to  develop.  This  revolution  is  deeply  linked  to  the  evolution  of  information  and  communication  technologies  (ITC).  When  these  into  production  systems,  new  characteristics  appear.  Indeed,  production  systems  are  not  only  able  to  communicate with other systems and their environment, but they are also  able to make decisions at the local level. These characteristics allow for more  flexibility and agility in production strategies and entail a need for flexible,  low-volume,  high-mix  manufacturing  in  a highly uncertain  environment  in  which  planning  and  control  of  production  under  disruption  becomes  a  decisive  decision-making  issue.  In  this  AR,  students  will  tackle,  through  specific case studies, typical problems in the design of flexible production  systems (i.e. task scheduling problem in production, production robustness  analysis,  etc).  Through  modeling  tools  (e.g.  probabilistic  model  checking)  that allow to take into account different uncertainty factors, students will  learn  basic  principles  for  performance  analysis  and  optimization  of  these  systems that are the basis of smart factories.   447
