         ST5 - 53 - AUTONOMOUS AND CONNECTED VEHICLE     Dominante : SCOC (Communicating Systems and Connected Objects)  Langue d’enseignement : French  Campus où le cours est proposé : Paris-Saclay     Engineering problem   Today's  vehicles  are  equipped  with  a  multitude  of  sensors  and  electronic  processing  that  provide  driving  assistance  and  even  a  certain  level  of  autonomy in well-defined contexts. Today's vehicles are also connected to  provide  information  on  traffic  conditions  and  navigation.  According  to  roadmaps in the field, by 2030, the vehicle should be subject to complete  connectivity  via  intelligent  communication  systems  and  adapted  technologies  to  enable  total  autonomy,  reducing  the  driver  to  a  simple  passenger who will only have to indicate his destination before departure.  But before we get there, engineers will have to help answer many questions,  of which we can give a taste. First of all, on a technical level, will technology  be  able  to  completely  replace  the  driver?  Or  how  can  such  systems  be  designed and validated while guaranteeing reliability and safety? From an  ethical and regulatory point of view, how can personal data be protected,  knowing  that  the  vehicle  will  be  connected  to  a  network  at  all  times  and  therefore  likely  to  communicate  information  outside  the  cabin?  From  an  economic point of view, upheavals are to be expected in the value chain of  the  automotive  sector  with  the  rise  of  the  GAFAMs  in  this  field  and  the  future management of vehicle systems by operators. On the societal level,  what new services could emerge? Finally, from an environmental point of  view,  how  can  we  ensure  that  the  autonomous  and  connected  vehicle  minimizes our ecological footprint?  During  this  thematic  sequence,  students  will  be  trained  in  functional  modeling methods, a preliminary step in any complex system design, and in  control techniques. A specific course on the issue will provide an overview  of  technologies  used  in  this  context  such  as  digital  methods  of  modeling,  simulation  and  validation  vehicles,  electronic  architectures  embedded,  processing of multi-sensor data fusion, artificial intelligence for the vehicle,  and communication protocols V2V and V2X. During the integration course,  students  will  have  to  put  into  perspective  all  the  knowledge  acquired,  starting  from  a  specification  and  going  up  to  the  validation  on  a  physical  platform, constituted here by a system of rolling robots.     384            Adviced prerequisites   It is advisable to have taken the SPI Electronic Systems course and the SPI  Networks and Security course.   Context and issue modules: This part is structured in conferences and round  tables  allowing  to  apprehend  the  problematic,  the  technologies  and  the  stakes  related  to  the  autonomous  and  connected  vehicle,  namely  the  associated  societal  stakes  such  as  safety, environment, traffic  fluidity, the  social-economic and industrial stakes.   Specific course (60 HEE) : Architecture and technology of the autonomous  vehicle   Brief description:   The  first  part  of  the  course  focuses  on  the  definition  of  an  autonomous  vehicle  mobility  system  and  in  particular  its  functional  architecture  (perception, processing, communication, actuation, but also propulsion and  energy conversion) as well as the development and validation methods of  autonomous  driving  systems  or  driver  assistance  systems  (AD/ADAS).  The  course  then  focuses  on  the  electrical  and  electronic  architecture  of  the  vehicle  (power  supply  network,  computers,  communication  bus  and  embedded sensors). It is also a question of understanding the physical and  environmental constraints to which the on-board electronics are subjected,  to  apprehend  the  problems  of  operating  safety  and  real-time  processing  crucial in the automotive field. Some of these concepts are addressed and  deepened through a workshop-type session in small groups around a case  study  of  a  level  4  autonomous  vehicle.  Also,  a  practical  session  allows  to  implement  a  real  time  embedded  image  processing  with  automatic  code  generation tools on electronic boards.   A second part addresses the processing and algorithms implemented for the  autonomous  vehicle.  Control  laws  specific  to  the  autonomous  vehicle  are  addressed  (Linear  Quadratic  Regulator,  Kalman  filtering,  neural  networks,  fuzzy logic...) as well as artificial intelligence (AI) techniques relevant to the  autonomous  vehicle  (supervised  learning,  connectionist  AI).  On  this  processing part, a practical session allows to study and test a control law for  automatic  parking,  another  one  aims  at  studying  the  basic  techniques  of  image  processing  and  a  third  one  studies  deep  learning  algorithms  in  an  automotive context.   385      A  third  part  focuses  on  vehicular  communication  technologies  with  a  comparison  of  existing  communication  means.  The  evaluation  of  the  performance of a vehicular communication network will be addressed and  this includes a study of the link budget for coverage as well as an analysis of  the  different  channel  access  mechanisms  (Aloha,  Slotted-Aloha  and  CSMA/CA).  A  practical  session  allows  the  simulation  and  practical  application of the concepts seen in this part.   Challenge  week  :  Design  of  a  "last  mile"  urban  delivery  system  using  autonomous and connected vehicles   Associated partner: Renault, Mathworks    - Location: Paris-Saclay campus   - Short description : The challenges of autonomous and connected vehicles  do not only concern the automotive sector. The integration course proposed  here will enable you to understand the design approach of a complex and  critical system, and the plurality of issues of the autonomous and connected  vehicle,  through  an  industrial  scenario  in  an  appropriate  context.  The  scenario chosen is that of a so-called "last mile" delivery, specified below.   The cost and delivery time of a parcel by carrier is strongly impacted by the  last  mile,  especially  in  urban  areas.  Because  of  traffic  jams  and  parking,  delivery trucks could advantageously be replaced at the entrance to large  cities by lighter means of transport adapted to the urban environment.    The use of bicycles is proving to be too costly; in the short term, transporters  are considering a fully automated last-mile delivery. The solution consists of  managing  a  fleet  of  autonomous  and  connected  robots  that  carry  out  delivery  routes  based  on  arrivals,  delivery  addresses  and  the  robots'  characteristics.   Delivery trucks drop off the robots at the entrance of city centers. Each robot  is in charge of one or more parcels and has a route to follow to deliver all  the parcels as quickly and efficiently as possible. In addition to being able to  move  efficiently  in  an  urban  environment  while  avoiding  obstacles,  pedestrians  and  other  vehicles,  the  robots  must  communicate  with  each  other (V2V) and with the infrastructure (V2I) in order to avoid, for example,  congestion points (demonstrations, work zones, etc.) and to have their route  re-planned in real time.   You will work in a team in charge of designing such a delivery system. You  will  follow  a  model-driven  system  engineering  approach  to  specify  the  system's functionalities. You will adopt a modeling methodology to develop  the  necessary  algorithms  (control/command,  sensor  fusion,  data  fusion,   386         decision  making  and  telecommunications)  to  meet  the  specifications.  A  small-scale  test  platform  will  allow  you  to  evaluate  the  quality  of  the  resulting delivery system and refine the algorithms.   During this work, you will have to take different points of view: system by  establishing  the  control/command  and  communication  strategy  between  vehicles;  functions  through  the  algorithms;  components  through  your  choices of implementation of these algorithms in order to take into account  the specific constraints of the application (latency, limited resources, etc.)      387
