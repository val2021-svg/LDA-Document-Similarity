         ST5 - 60 - SEMI-AUTONOMOUS NAVIGATION    OF DRONES     Dominante : MDS (Mathematics and Data Sciences)  Langue d’enseignement : English  Campus où le cours est proposé : Metz        Engineering problem     Data  collection  by  a  human  is  sometimes  extremely  difficult,  e.g.  for  exploration/monitoring  of  abandoned  mines  or  disused  buildings,  crop  monitoring, environmental monitoring. What makes it difficult for a human  to explore these areas may depend on the congestion of these areas (e.g.  riprap in mines), the accessibility of these areas (e.g. monitoring the state of  dykes, river banks ...), the size of the territory to be covered (e.g. monitoring  agricultural crops, rivers). In this respect, the recent development of drones  offers  many  opportunities  but  also  raises  several  problems.  To  date,  the  piloting of a drone still requires a certain level of expertise since its control  is quite low level. We can then consider a piloting assistance where some  aspects of the drone control are managed automatically, due to a processing  of the sensors' information flows by machine learning techniques. This semiautonomous control requires in this case to build from the information of  the sensors more integrated representations from which the human, as well  as the automatic controller which assists him, can ensure in concert a robust  navigation of the UAV.     Advised prerequisites   The specific course and the integration teaching require a mastery of several  tools  (ROS,  Linux,...)  to  which  the  students  will  be  trained.  However,  this  training to these new tools requires a real motivation and implication of the  students. It is also necessary to have skills in Python programming.   Context and issue modules:     This  part  is  structured  in  conferences  and  round  tables  allowing  to  understand  the  problems,  technologies  and  stakes  related  to  the  use  of  UAVs in several target areas of the sequence (interventions to be confirmed  from Parrot, Safran...)   463         Specific course n°1 (10 HEE) : Introductory practical work   Brief description : These practical works aim at training students to use Linux  (Ubuntu),  OpenCV  under  Python.  The  knowledge  acquired will be used in  the other activities of the sequence.   Specific course n°2 (60 HEE) : Autonomous Robotics   Short description : This course will present the field of autonomous robotics  (vehicle driving, exploration and inspection robots, ...) by showing how this  problematic integrates very diverse technologies (localization (SLAM), point  clouds, planning, pattern recognition) and how this integration is achieved  at the system level (illustrations with ROS). The laboratory work associated  with the course will be carried out on the Turtlebots mobile robots available  in the smartroom of the Metz campus. This work will be an opportunity to  integrate  different  machine  learning  and  signal  processing  techniques  on  robots  moving  in  their  environment  by  progressively  building  a  system  allowing manual control but also autonomous mapping and navigation in an  unknown environment.   inspection  by  a  semi-autonomous  drone   Challenge  Week :  Building  (quadricopter)   Associated partner: Parrot   - Location : Metz campus   -  Short  description  :  Students  will  work  on  issues  related  to  technical  inspection by drones (visual and thermal diagnosis) of hard-to-reach areas  of industrial sites, on case studies provided by the industrial partners. They  will  thus  provide  answers  to  their  needs  in  terms  of  improving  energy  performance  and  detecting  possible  degradations,  allowing  in  particular  significant savings at the level of the sites considered.   integrated  machine   The  students  will  have  implemented  servo-control  techniques  with  the  particularity of including a human operator in the control loop. They will also  have  (vector  quantization,  supervised  learning)  on  an  industrial  case,  for  the  interpretation  of  information flows from sensors (mainly video). This is a first contact with the  field  of  machine  learning  through  the  application  and  experimental  side.  They  will  have  acquired,  through  this  experience,  a  more  general  competence on the design of robotic systems with ROS.   learning  techniques      464
