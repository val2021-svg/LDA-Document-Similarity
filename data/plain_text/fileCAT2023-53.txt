   2EL2120 - Design Science       Instructors: Flore VALLET  Department: DÉPARTEMENT GÉNIE INDUSTRIEL ET OPÉRATIONS  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Business Sciences  Advanced level : No      Description  This course allows to understand the major concepts of Design Science and  Engineering, and to practically experiment the design of products, services  and business models on various examples. The design examples are, among  others: launch of a brand new hotel chain, design of an apartment bicycle,  of  a  commercial  airplane,  of  a  smartphone  for  more  inclusiveness,  perceptual  and  emotional  design  of  a  wine  glass,  service  design  in  the  context  of  a  classy  restaurant  or  a  hotel  reception,  design  a  carpooling  service, business model of a travel agency.   The lecture is reduced to 1.5 hour out of 3 per session, in order to leave room  for  rich  and  varied  contexts  of  experimentation  (case  studies  during  exercises,  practice  of  design  platforms,  debates,  quiz  and  final  poster  session). One debate is organized with several invited design practitioners.     Quarter number  SG6     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  no prerequisite     Syllabus   The 10 course sessions cover a variety of design topics.     1. Introduction   This session introduces the activity of designing from a historical  perspective, the vocabulary and stakes of design, the design  communities and the convictions of a group of academics that design is  a scientific discipline. “What is design? What can be designed? Why is it  a science?” are the questions addressed by the lecture and debated by  the students.     2. Design process    174      The interest of describing design processes is illustrated. Prescribing a  design process is done with the underlying idea that it is likely to have a  good design outcome when a quality design process has been  conducted. Four types of prescribed design processes are presented.  First, some generic and simple models are described such as Design  Thinking, double-diamond and Radical Innovation Design. Second, some  Engineering Design (ED) models, well adapted to design complex  engineering systems, are presented. Third, New Product Development  (NPD) models like the Stage-Gate® model of Cooper are presented in  the context of large industrial and business projects where market  analysis, innovation strategy and project management are important.  Finally, it is shown that large companies are generally adopting a fourth  approach that of hybridizing the ED and NPD approaches, with the use  of Design Thinking in the system innovation part.    3. Capturing and expressing the need - Part I: conventional  requirements engineering   Design requirements describe the characteristics that a product must  have to meet the needs of the stakeholders. They are made of  functional requirements (service functions) and non-functional  requirements (quality attributes and constraints).    4. Capturing and expressing the need - Part II: non-conventional  requirements engineering   Non-conventional requirements engineering techniques are evoked:  Use case, user story, emotional engineering, perceptual design, opinion  mining. They constitute a wide range of requirements specification  techniques available to designers.    5. Design a product   The concept of product architecture is defined. The process of designing  is presented as a top-down multi-level structural design while adopting  design principles. It is shown how a function is represented as a flow  inside a structure representation and how a value analysis allows to  balance the design choices of the structure with the functional  requirements.    6. Design a service   Goods and services can be viewed as supporting human activities and a  design process can be considered as a transformation of a user activity  system. Service blueprinting is presented as the means to represent a  service and to improve it. The tools for designing a product and  designing a service are finally compared. The conclusion leads to the  necessary hybridization of product design and service design methods,  and consequently advocates for the design of Product-Service Systems  (PSS).     175      7. Design for, by and with people   It is imperative to know how to design for people (designers learn from  the usage expertise of people), design with people (users are active  participants in the design process) and design by people (designers help  users to become design actors and make their own decisions). In the  first part (for and with people), personas and customer journey maps  are studied as major tools. In the second part, it is illustrated how  human models and human beings may be used in the design process.  One speaks of Human-in-The-Loop (HiTL) simulations.    8. Universal design   The observation can be made that, still today, most of the time  companies design products and services in the “one size fits all” mode  for a perfect “averaged” customer. In consequence, designers do not  consider the diversity of people and of activity contexts during the  design process so as to ensure that the design outcome effectively  delivers its expected value with a satisfactory user experience. Impaired,  elderly and young people are example of often ignored (not so small)  minorities. Universal design - also “called design” for all or “inclusive  design” - is defined as the design of products and environments to be  usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need  for adaptation or specialized design. The inclusive design process of EDC  Cambridge is presented in details and some extensions are proposed.  This inclusive design process is not intended to be used only in extreme  situations, but it pretends to be a generic design process to follow as  soon as the product or service to design requires a human interaction.    9. Design a business model   The business model is the concept that allows a company to make  money, the business plan is the operational plan to achieve it. A  business model describes the rationale of how an organization intends  to create, capture and deliver value. Several canvases are presented to  represent and design it, among them the famous Business Model  Canvas (BMC). It is then showed that the BMC may be not enough for  guaranteeing success on the market. A BMC-RID variant has been  proposed to consolidate its weakest points.    10. Prototype, test and validate   The cycle « Prototyping - Testing/Experimenting - Evaluating -  Validating » is situated at the end of a design process. It is shown that  the design of a prototype derives from the design of an appropriate  experiment with expected evaluations, deriving from a subset of  challenging performances (specified in the requirements specifications),  deriving from a value proposition, deriving from an activity to improve.  Numerous techniques of virtual and physical prototyping are presented,  notably videos for illustrating existing usage scenarios and dreamt usage   176      scenarios. Finally, the importance of documenting during the design  process and especially the prototyping stage is evoked.          Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)   Each class session is typically composed of 1h30 presentation of the daily  topic, and 1h30 of exercises. During one session, a debate is organized with  invited design practitioners.  There are 60 WLH in total, compared to the 33 hours of lectures and  exercises and 2h of final poster session. The 25 additional hours are  decomposed in 1h30 in average for completing the exercise after each  session by groups of 4, and 7 hours to prepare the final poster session.        Grading  The final grade is composed of 15% of the homeworks (in group), 35%  indivual quiz and 50% of the final poster (also in group).  The final poster session consists in the documentation of a trend, method,  tool, concept or particular project or designer of Design Engineering &  Science. Let us call it an object for instance Jugaad innovation, Minimum  Viable Product, Eco-innovation, The practice of Design Thinking in  companies...  The poster must illustrate:    •  The principles of your object  •  Its stakes  •  Its successes and failures so far  •  Its economical interests  •  Its compatibility and interests in regards with the U.N.   Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)   •  Your clear-cut opinion “We should do that or avoid to   do that…”   ... and it must be illustrated, cool, informative and original!  A very funny, participative and intensive poster presentation is organized.  By groups, you present your poster several times: to professors, to  classmates and you are yourself in a jury to evaluate the posters of your  classmates. Each presentation is 5 min. + 8 min. Q&A.
