      2CC1000 - Control theory       Instructors: Didier Dumur  Department: DÉPARTEMENT AUTOMATIQUE  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS, FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY, CAMPUS DE RENNES, CAMPUS DE METZ  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 36,00          Description   The  physical  systems  generally  rely  on  the  fundamental  concept  of  a  feedback loop, allowing them to be controlled and giving them a behavior  that is as insensitive as possible to environmental disturbances. The general  objective of this course is to provide students with the concepts and skills  enabling them to understand the structure and interactions within existing  dynamic systems or along with their design. They will also be able to process  information,  design  a  control  law  to  meet  specifications,  and  analyze  its  performance and robustness. To achieve this, the students must first be able  to define a model (or a set of models), highlighting the variables influencing  the state of this system (inputs), the measures allowing access to this state,  and  variables  to  which  the  specifications  relate  (outputs),  as  well  as  the  relationships between these variables. Then, in a second step, and from the  analysis of the inputs that can be controlled (commands) or those that are  undergone (disturbances), students will have to design a control law in order  to  ensure  the  expected  performances.  The  last  step  in  this  course  will  concern the analysis of the robustness of the determined control law.

Understand and analyze the interest of a closed-loop control structure    2. Model the behavior of a dynamic system by a time representation (statestate representation) or possibly a frequential one:    • choose a model (or a set of models) suitable to the control  and/or analysis objective (linearization, model reduction, etc.)  • validate the relevance of the model (or of the set of  proposed models)   3. Design control laws based on the state-space representation of the  system, if necessary, by the synthesis of an observer.    • analyze the characteristics of the initial system and compare  them to the specifications  • choose and design the appropriate control law  • determine an observer allowing to estimate the unmeasured  state variables  • validate in simulation and experimentally the control law and  criticize the obtained results  • analyze the performance and robustness of control law   4. Use simulation software to implement theoretical developments and  validate control laws (particularly through experimental work)    5. Master scientific and technical communication (through the report of lab  work)     Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course   Validated skills:  - Concerning the skill C1 "Analyze, design and build complex systems with  scientific, technological, human and economic components", evaluated in  this module:   * "Model the behaviour of a dynamic system by means of a  time domain or frequency domain representation" is included  in the skill C1.2 "Use and develop appropriate models, choose  the right modelling scale and the relevant simplifying  hypotheses to deal with a problem"    * "Analyse the time and/or frequency domain behaviour of a  system and the effects of feedback" is included in the skill C1.1  "Study a problem as a whole and an overall situation. Identify,  formulate and analyse a problem in its scientific, economic and  human dimensions"     16      * "Determine a control law by state feedback (completed if  necessary by the synthesis of an observer), in order to satisfy a  temporal and/or frequential specification" is included in the  skill C1.4 "Specify, design, implement and validate all or part of  a complex system"    * "Validate a control law by means of simulation or  experiments and critisize the obtain results" is included in the  skills C1.3 "Solve a problem by means of approximation,  simulation and experiments"    - Concerning the skill C2 "Develop in-depth skills in an engineering field and  in a family of professions", evaluated in this module:    * "Model the behaviour of a dynamic system" and Analyzing  the characteristics of the initial system and comparing them to  the specifications" requires an appropriation of the field of  application considered together with its constraints, and is  therefore part of C2.2 "Importing knowledge from other fields  or disciplines" and C2.3 “Identify and independently acquire  the required new knowledge and skills”    * "Analyze the performance and robustness of control laws" is  part of C2.4 "Produce data and develop knowledge according  to a scientific approach"    * "Use simulation software to implement theoretical  developments and validate control laws (in particular through  experimental work)" is part of C2.4 "Producing data and  developing knowledge according to a scientific approach”   - "Master scientific and technical communication (through reports during  lab works)" is included in the skill C7.1 "Render complex content  intelligible. Structure one’s ideas and arguments. Synthesize and see the  bigger picture". This skill is not evaluated in this module.    Evaluation of the learning outcomes  Skills C1 and C2 will be evaluated in two different situations:   - Two lab work sessions will enable evaluating all these three  learning outcomes, students having a real process to model,  analyse and control. In particular, this pedagogical method  allows students to experience experimental training and  validation of the modelling and design approach    - A final exam will also confront students with a real problem  of a process that should be modelled, analysed and controlled.  The emphasis will be less on experimental aspects than on the   17      ability to satisfy an industrial problem through its  specifications.   The skill C2.4 will be more specifically assessed during the lab work  sessions, as well as during personal work (requiring the implementation of  the process via a simulation software) between the two lab work sessions.    The skill C7 will not be evaluated, but it will be more specifically handled  through the report following the lab work sessions  18
