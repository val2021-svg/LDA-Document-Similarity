   2SC7693 - Optimization of infrasonic wave detection    for verification of the Comprehensive    Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty       Instructors: Stephane Vialle  Department: DOMINANTE - MATHÉMATIQUES, DATA SCIENCES, DOMINANTE -  INFORMATIQUE ET NUMÉRIQUE  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 80  On-site hours (HPE): 48,00        Description     Project topic in partnership with CEA DAM.    Rmk : Project proposed to students of European Union    CEA-DAM uses high performance computing resources for its various missions,  particularly in the environmental monitoring field (e.g. seismic or acoustic wave  propagation  phenomena).  The  “Département  d'Ile  de  France”  located  in  Bruyères-le-Châtel is thus the tsunamis and strong earthquakes french warning  center. As part of its missions and based on its skills in the nuclear area as well  as in detection and identification technologies, CEA-DAM also brings its expertise  for  fighting  against  nuclear  proliferation  and  terrorism.  In  order  to  inform  national authorities in case of a nuclear test, CEA-DAM thus participates in the  implementation  of  verification  means  to  assess  the  non-violation  of  the  “Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty” (CTBT).    The  study  proposed  here  concerns  the  characterization  and  detection  of  infrasonic  waves  at  long  distances,  taking  into  account  the  topography  and  atmospheric conditions (e.g. wind here). A compressible 2D axisymmetric / 3D  hydrocode  which  supports  adaptive  mesh  refinement  (AMR)  and  hybrid  parallelism (MPI domain decomposition / OpenMP multithreading) on Cartesian  grids is developed in our laboratory. It can simulate the propagation of blast and  acoustic  waves  in  the  presence  of  relief  and  buildings,  with  or  without  wind.  Judiciously located sensors allow overpressure signals recordings.    Two  types  of  problems  which  will  be  solved  with  this  AMR  hydrocode  are  addressed here. The first one consists in localizing an explosion and determining  its power on the basis of probes’ recordings located in the scene. The second one  consists in defining judicious sensors locations in order to maximize the chances  of detection in case of explosions in a given area. In both cases, a "brute force"  investigation consisting in simulating all possible configurations before retaining   554      the best one is unthinkable. It would consume gigantic hours of computations,  which would make the design of the solution very long and overpriced.    For these two types of problems, the objective of this study is therefore twofold:   •  Propose a solution to characterize the source of acoustic waves.  •  Find this solution in a reasonable time on high-performance computers   AND with a limited quota of computation hours.     To that end we will develop an optimization loop that uses the hydrocode the  most  efficiently  as  possible,  by  parsimoniously  exploring  the  possible  configurations space, to economically find a “good” solution.    Technical details of the studied systems   •  1st topic: characterization of a source at the urban scale, taking into   account buildings   It consists in locating and determining the power of an explosion, following  an  accident  or  a  malicious  act,  knowing  only  neighboring  sensors  recordings (whose locations are known). Buildings in the surrounding area  will be taken into account. Here, the recordings will come out in practice  from a simulation whose fictitious initial conditions (location and power of  the source) will not be known by the students.   •   2nd topic: setting up a surveillance network    Here,  it  is  question  of  designing  a  sensors  network  allowing  the  detection of hypothetic explosive experiments around an area that is  under  surveillance.  These  sensors  -  in  limited  numbers  -  should  be  judiciously  located  in  order  to  maximize  chances  of  detection  whatever the weather (we will only consider wind here) and the relief  are. Furthermore and for maintenance reasons, the sensors will only  be located in so-called "accessible areas”.
