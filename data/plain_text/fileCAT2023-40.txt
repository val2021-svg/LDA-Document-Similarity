   2EL1760 - Scientific calculation       Instructors: Hachmi Ben Dhia  Department: DÉPARTEMENT MATHÉMATIQUES  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Fundamental Sciences  Advanced level : Yes      Description  The course is both a rigorous and applied brick, contributing to the design  of complex mechanical systems through modeling, mathematical analysis,  approximation and controlled simulations of engineering problems in solids  and fluid mechanics. This covers sectors such as Energy, transportation and  aerospace.    The educational goal is that students following this course gain a good  understanding of the chain integrating modeling, mathematical analysis  and simulation for the study of such complex systems, trough simplified  still relevant of solid and fluid mechanics.       Quarter number  SG8     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  Basic knowledge in Continuum Mechanics: CM Hypotheses-Classical  Mechanical Fields for Solids and Fluids-basic governing equations and  meaning of these equations-Basic notions of differentiation and  integration-Basic notions on Hilbert spaces and weak formulations of PDEsBasic notions on stability and prime notions on space and time  approximation schemes for PDEs. Roughly speaking : a first year CS level of  knowledge in Mathematics and Mechanics or a third University year in  Applied Mathematics to Mechanics.       Syllabus  The course is composed of two successive parts of 5,5 x 3h, each.   1. Compressible fluid flows simulation :  - Flow models, discontinuous solutions, Entropy, Basic solvers,  extensions  - Practical implementation   137      2.
