   2SC5210 - Chemical Engineering: application to   environment and biomanufacturing       Instructors: Cristian-Felipe Puentes Mancipe  Department: DÉPARTEMENT MÉCANIQUE ENERGÉTIQUE PROCÉDÉS  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 34,50      Description  Modern  chemical  engineering  deals  with  designing,  operating,  and  optimizing  environmentally  friendly  processes  for  the  development  of  a  variety of products and services in many traditional and high-tech sectors  (pharmaceuticals,  petroleum,  fine  chemicals,  food  processing,  cosmetics,  water  and  waste  treatment,  materials,  biotechnologies,  etc.),  and  for  the  production  of  traditional  (nuclear,  thermal,  etc.)  and  renewable  energies.  Chemical engineering methodologies are widely used to ensure the recycling  and  recovery  of  numerous  products  and  the  purification  of  liquid  and  gaseous  effluents,  thus  becoming  tools  of  choice  in  the  strategy  of  sustainable development on a global scale.  The  challenges  associated  with  this  environmental  issue  are  numerous:  reducing  costs,  risks  and  dangers,  waste,  and  energy  and  raw  material  consumption.  Process  intensification  is  the  major  lever  for  taking  these  challenges up.    This  course  its  methodologies,  allowing  students  to  acquire  generalist  tools  that  can  be  easily  transposed  to  multiple  fields,  such  as  biotechnology  and  the  environment.  It  is  fully  in  line  with  the  environment,  energy  and  health  issues.  Most  of  the  case  studies  are  focused  on  bioprocesses  used  in  industrial biotechnology. The development of these bioprocesses is growing  rapidly  due  to  the  use of  living  organisms  to transform  matter  and  purify  polluted  systems,  and  the  employment  of  biomass  to  replace  fossil  resources.    Bioprocesses are studied at the industrial bioreactor scale. The description  and understanding of biological processes (metabolism, maintenance, etc.)  at the cell level are not addressed. The biological agents are thus considered  as cellular catalysts transforming raw materials into products according to  known kinetic laws.    Quarter number  ST5    introduction  to  chemical  engineering  and   is  an   370        Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)    None.  The case studies conducted involve biochemical or chemical reactions.  However, no prior knowledge of chemistry or biology is required.       Syllabus    1.

Thermal energy balances  Case study: Design of a bioreactor for baker's yeast production in batch  mode (biomass production by industrial biotechnology)  4. Liquid-vapor equilibria, flash distillation  Application exercise: Flash distillation of ethanol-water mixture  (purification of biofuel, alternative to fossil fuels)  5. Multi-stage distillation  Case study: Multi-stage distillation of bioethanol (purification of biofuel,  alternative to fossil fuels)  6. Mass transfer: Diffusion and Convection  Case study: Raceway production of Spirulina microalgae (production of  nutrients for food and feed by industrial biotechnology)  7. Mass transfer: Permanent Contact Technologies  Case study: treatment of a gaseous effluent with pollutant removal  (environmental process)  8. Training for the challenge week  Case study: modeling and simulation of a bioprocess for polymer  production (production of added value molecules by industrial  biotechnology)     Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)  The course module is organized in lectures (10,5 h), to introduce  knowledge and methodological tools, which will be then applied through  case studies (13,5 h).
