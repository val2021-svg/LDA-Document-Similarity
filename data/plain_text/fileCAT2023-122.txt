   2SC5490 - Design project for an eco-neighborhood       Instructors: Frédérique Delmas-Jaubert, Franck MARLE  Department: DOMINANTE - GRANDS SYSTÈMES EN INTERACTION, DOMINANTE -  CONSTRUCTION VILLE TRANSPORTS  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 40  On-site hours (HPE): 27,00          Description  The purpose of the integration project is to make the preliminary design of  an eco-district.  Projects are carried out in groups of about twenty students. However, they  are  also  broken  down  into  smaller  elements,  called  district  modules  (residential buildings, public equipment, roads, and networks).  Each team should find solutions to satisfy several objectives (the eco-district  referential). Some of these objectives are at the district level (urban shape,  economic balance, ...).  Several deliverables are expected at all scales: individual level, team (subgroup), and group.         Quarter number  ST5     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  Specific module : sustainable urban planning     Syllabus   (if the case is confirmed)    The Corbeville ZAC:  what future in the short, medium, and long term for this  space  near  the  interchange  of  the  N118?  A project  was  submitted  by the  EPAPS  to  a  public  inquiry  in  the  spring  of  2019.  One  or  more  significant  parameters  of  the  existing  studies  are  modified  (political  orientation,  mobility solutions, the ambition of density, ...). We propose to analyze the  consequences of these changes on the urban project.    Input data :  - Historical aerial photo   400      - Maps available on geoportal (in particular IGN with topography,  watercourse, and existing building)  - Insee data available online  - Program and guide EPAPS of the district of Moulon     Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)  Sprint-based project (3 sprints of 1,5 days each).  Self-organized and connected teams within the group, sprint reviews with  each group supervisor.  Opportunity to get specific expertise during some sessions.   Deliverables must be done throughout the week (detailed schedule  presented the first day).       Grading  Continuous assessment, based on group deliverables. An individual  deliverable is also assessed.      Resources   Supervisors and experts are professors, architects, urbanists, engineers,  researchers, ...

C1.5 Bring together  broad scientific and technical concepts in a core  structure that is nestled in an interdisciplinary approach.   C3.6 Evaluate the efficiency, feasibility and strength of the solutions  offered.   C7.1 Persuade at the level of core values; to be clear about objectives and  expected results. To apply rigour when it comes to assumptions and  structured undertakings, and in doing so structure and problematise the  ideas themselves. To make the added value known.   C8.4 Work using project management techniques appropriately tailored to  the situation  C9.4  Demonstrate rigour and critical thinking in approaching problems  from all angles, be they scientific, social or economic.    401
