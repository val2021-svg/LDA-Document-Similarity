   2SC6291 - Hierarchical management of thermal comfort      Instructors: Herve Gueguen, Romain Bourdais  Department: DOMINANTE - SYSTÈMES COMMUNICANTS ET OBJETS CONNECTÉS,  DOMINANTE - GRANDS SYSTÈMES EN INTERACTION  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: Rennes  Workload (HEE): 40  On-site hours (HPE): 27,00          Description    The building must no longer be considered as a simple consumer but as a  real  energy  actor  perfectly  integrated  into  its  ecosystem.  It  must  be  fully  integrated into a renewed vision of society, where comfort and health are in  harmony  with  energy  management.  This  requires  rethinking  the  systems  through  new  steering  functions  and  stronger  interactions  with  occupants.  The "building" ecosystem is complex, because it consists of a heterogeneous  set  of  systems:  local  production,  storage,  supply,  sale,  and  the  various  equipment, which must be coordinated for optimized management.  The challenges facing the engineers are first the analysis of needs and the  specification  of  intelligent  control  systems.   This  design  is  based  on  the  integration  of  control  algorithms  deployed  on  communicating  systems  to  achieve an optimal compromise between technology - cost - efficiency, such  as closed loop performance, communication frequency and protocol, sensor  autonomy and actuator life.    The  objective  is  to  define  a  modular  system,  allowing  to  implement  hierarchical control strategies between a local regulation of comfort by zone  and  a  supervisor  managing  the  intermittency  of  the  occupation,  the  limitation of available power in order to minimize the consumption related  to  thermal  comfort.  The  challenges  induced  by  this  project  are  the  consideration  of  societal  issues  (human,  comfort  and  energy  efficiency),  technical  constraints  (power  limitation,  ease  of  implementation  and  robustness of the solution) and technologies allowing implementation. The  different groups will have to work together to address the different aspects  of the project and result in a proof of concept implementation.       Quarter number  ST5    483        Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)   Control theory (commun course 2A)    One of the 2 courses:   •  High Energy Performance Communications  •  System Architecture and Modeling      Syllabus    This course is built from a simulator/emulator of the thermal behaviour of a  building, whose meteorological data and conditions of use are taken from  data from the city of Rennes.    The energy manager that the students will have to build will have to be  implemented and validated in the simulator.     Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)    The pedagogical activity alternates between working together and working  in mini-groups to arrive at a collective proposal at the end of the week. The  courses  are  in  French  with  specific  modalities  to  allow  the  adaptation  of  students  with  a  low  level  in  French:  all  the  materials  are  in  English,  the  tutorials, the practical work as well as the integration teaching are provided  in English. English support sessions are also scheduled.     Grading    The activity will be evaluated during the various daily points and during the  final presentation.      Resources    A  building  thermal  simulator  is  made  available  to  the  students.  They  will  then  be  able  to  work  in  groups  on  the  project,  taking  advantage  of  the  supervision of 2 research professors of the school with complementary skills  (system modeling and automation)     Learning outcomes covered on the course    At the end of this teaching, the students will be able to:  - implement a collaborative control strategy    484      - simulate the behavior of the building and evaluate the relevance of the  proposed solution  - present a technological solution and valorize it from a technical-economic  point of view     Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course    C4.1 : Identify and (re) formulate the customer's need to create value and  the associated challenges or constraints. Identify and integrate other  stakeholders, internal and external, and other dimensions not mentioned  initially (technical, economic, human, etc.)   C6.2 : Design software  C7.1 : Basically: Structure ideas and arguments, be synthetic (assumptions,  objectives, expected results, approach, and value created)   485
