Learning outcomes covered on the course  - Know the key figures (state of play and scientific forecasts) that are the  subject of so much debate in the media when they involve stakeholders in  an environmental conflict, for example industrialists and ecologists.  - Understand the assumptions and models on which these figures are  based.  - Raise awareness of the coupling of resources, energy, environment,  climate, economy, geopolitics, demography  - Raise awareness at different levels: local to global       Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course  C1.1 Examine a problem in its full scope and depth, within and beyond its  immediate parameters, in order to understand it as a whole. This set links  the scientific, economic and social dimensions of the problem.    C2.1 Master a field or discipline based on the basic or engineering sciences.    C4.1 Think in terms of customers, identify and analyse customer needs,  other stakeholder constraints and societal challenges.    C9.4 Demonstrate rigour and critical thinking by approaching problems  from all angles, scientific, human and economic.   187
