               ST7 - 77 - EFFICIENCY OF ON-BOARD ENERGY SYSTEMS     Dominante : ENE (Energy)  Langue d’enseignement : French  Campus où le cours est proposé : Paris-Saclay        Engineering problem   The  optimization  of  embedded  energy  systems  is  a  problem  encountered  daily in the industrial world.   Whether  the  objective  is  to  reduce  production  or  usage  costs,  or  to  participate  in  the  energy  transition  by  minimizing  the  carbon  footprint,  optimization is essential in the energy world.   Volume, cost (optimal design or operating cost), performance or efficiency  gains are objectives that can be found in aeronautical, space or automotive  systems. The system and multiphysics aspect of the design is now taken into  account in order to best meet increasingly demanding specifications.   During this sequence, industrial examples will be discussed: optimization of  the efficiency and cost of an electric drive train on a few operating points or  on road cycles, optimal management of energy sources in a hybrid system.   Advised prerequisites   It is advised to have taken the course "Electrical Energy".   Context  and  issue  modules :  These  modules  include  an  introductory  conference  on  the  theme,  a  round  table  involving  the  partners  in  the  sequence, presentations on the technological and scientific obstacles, and  an innovation workshop.   Specific course (60 HEE) : Optimization of embedded energy systems   Brief description: After a description and formulation of the problem and a  presentation  of  the  models  related  to  optimization,  the  techniques  of  optimization  of  energy  systems,  stochastic  optimization,  parameter  estimation, multi-source optimization and multi-criteria optimization will be  examined.   571            Project n°1 : Energy efficiency of electrical machines   - Associated partner: Leroy-Sommer   - Location: Paris-Saclay   -  Brief  description  :  The  problem  of  energy  optimization  of  electrical  machines is posed on the one hand by a search for lower costs of use but  also by the regulation which imposes increasingly high yields to control the  electrical demand.   It is therefore necessary to optimize the efficiency of electrical machines. Of  course,  this  maximization  of  the  efficiency  goes  against  another  optimization: that of the manufacturing cost. A multi-criteria optimization  between efficiency and cost will therefore be implemented.   Project n°2 : Optimization of the traction chain on road cycle   - Associated partner :    - Location: Paris-Saclay campus   -  Brief  description  :  The  increase  in  the  price  of  fossil  fuels  as  well  as  environmental constraints are pushing the automotive and mobility sector  to turn more and more to electric traction as a replacement or complement  to the combustion engine.   The electric motor in the vehicle is not used on a single operating point as it  is the case for a static application, but must respond to the solicitations of  driving. To model these behaviors, numerous road test cycles are used. The  optimization  of  the  powertrain  as  a  system  is  made  complicated  and  expensive  by  the  large  number  of  operating  points  generated  by  these  cycles. Reduction techniques will therefore be used to optimize the yields or  the masses of the systems.   Project n°3 : Optimal management of a hybrid generator   - Associated partner :    - Location: Paris-Saclay campus   - Brief description: An energy production generator converts a source into  energy.  A  generator  is  said  to  be  hybrid  when  there  are  several  sources   572         available (in the electric case, it can be a battery and a thermal engine and  alternator). The choice of the primary energy source is therefore made at  the time of use.    On an operating cycle (power demand curve for example), it is necessary to  find  the  optimal  set  point  leading  to  the  best  management  of  the  hybrid  generator: to know if the electricity is produced from the battery or from the  thermal generator.   An optimization is therefore necessary to reduce the operating costs or to  increase  the  efficiency.  Subsequently,  an  optimization  of  the  system  according to this optimal management is possible.   Project n°4: Optimization of a naval propulsion chain on cycle   - Associate partner: DCNS   - Location: Paris-Saclay campus   -  Brief  description:  90%  of  world  trade  is  carried  out  by  sea.  As  a  result,  maritime transport is one of the main contributors to air pollution: 3% of  total greenhouse gas emissions in the world. Naval electric propulsion is one  of the candidates to replace conventional thermal propulsion systems.   In an electric ship, gas turbines or diesel generators produce electricity that  is  then  used  to  power  both  the  electric  propulsion  motors  and  auxiliary  loads. The electrical system on board can be AC or DC. Such a system must  be optimized to minimize its cost and maximize its efficiency. In particular, if  the vessel follows a fixed route (such as a ferry), the optimization can take  into account the operating cycle.      573
