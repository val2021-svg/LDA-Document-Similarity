   2IN1570 - Web and mobile application development       Instructors: Benoit VALIRON  Department: DÉPARTEMENT INFORMATIQUE  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 40  On-site hours (HPE): 27,00  Elective Category : Fundamental Sciences  Advanced level : Yes        Description   Current web technologies go beyond than simple static webpages.  Dedicated to interactions, they are versatile enough to be able to design  application for all kind of terminals, from desktop to smartphones.  Connected to the internet, these apps exchange data based on a common  set of formats to structure and manipulate it, such as XML for example.    The objective of this course is to discover the technologies on which are  based web-apps and mobile-apps, focusing on the use and manipulation of  concepts and the realization of a small, yet complete application.       Quarter number  Intensive week at the end of the SG8     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  The course "Information Systems and Programming" (ISP)     Syllabus    The course shall consists of the following 5 modules. 1 - Core concepts and  technologies for the web ; 2 - Dynamic interaction with the user in the  browser ;  3 - Structured data ; 4 - Architecture of a web-app and of a  mobile-app ; 5 - Advanced topics.        Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)  The course focuses on practicing the concepts: The presentation of a  notion is followed with a lab-session to immediately apply and practice it.      635      Grading  The grading of the course is based on two things : 1 - continuous  assessment, each lab session being submitted for evaluation, and 2 - each  student will build and hand over a project implementing the concepts seen  along the course.     Course support, bibliography   The course consists in a series of tutorials, available online as the course  will progress.  One can nonetheless cite the following bibliography:   •  W. S. Means, E.

Resources  The course is made  of 5 modules incrementally presenting the core  concepts of web and mobile programming. Each module consists in a  theoretical part (with a corresponding lecture) and a practical part (lab  sessions) for the students to manipulate the concepts.     Learning outcomes covered on the course  At the end of the course, the students will be able to    •  Know and use standards techniques of web-app design   o  Describe the various parts composing a web-app.  o  Implement each technology seen along the course to a   simple case-study.   •  Design and build a complete web-app, with client and server.   o  Propose a consistent orchestration of the components of   o  Allow different access mode to the service depending on the   o  Evaluate and choose the pertinent technologies for a given   the web-app   web-client   goal        Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course  Skill C6.4 : Solve problems through mastery of computational thinking skills.  636
