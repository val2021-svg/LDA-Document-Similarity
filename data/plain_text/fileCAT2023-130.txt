Quarter number  ST5     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  Electric energy     Syllabus  1.    Presentation of the different elements of the hybrid power train :    Introduction to the environmental, economic constraints   Presentation of ways to increase the overall efficiency of the powertrain  and the structure of a hybrid drive train  Presentation of the combustion engine, structure of the automotive  industry  Control of electrical machines (choice between MCC and synchronous  machine), for integration in a system model  2.    Application and development of a numerical model :   Presentation of the hybrid system model in Simulink :   Implementation of the different parts of the block diagram: car model,  combustion engine, gearbox, electric motor coupling, batteries.  Presentation of a flow management strategy on WLTP consumption cycle.
