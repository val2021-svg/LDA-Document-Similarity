   2SC5191 - Control strategy of a nanosatellite       Instructors: Giorgio Valmorbida  Department: DOMINANTE - GRANDS SYSTÈMES EN INTERACTION, DOMINANTE -  CONSTRUCTION VILLE TRANSPORTS  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 40  On-site hours (HPE): 27,00      Description  This module is developed in partnership with Thalès Alenia Space. The main  goal is to introduce the main tasks on the design of a nanosatellite. For a  satellite  mission,  the  participants  will  propose  a  satellite  orbit,  choose  sensors  and  actuators,  design  the  mission  modes,  propose  a  dynamical  model,  design  a  control  laws,   simulate  the  trajectories  and  assess  the  resulting performances.     Quarter number  ST5     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)   Course "Cubesat design and control: attitude and orbit control systems" of  the specific course "performance and flight trajectories".      Syllabus  Traceability  matrix  :  methods  for  the  validation  and  verification  of  requirements. Proposal of mission modes, hardware selection. Definition of  pointing,  mass  and  power  budgets.  Disturbance  torque  assessments.  Selection, layout and sizing hardware components.   Dynamics modeling, and simulation including torque disturbances. Writing  the technical notice.      Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)  The  group  will  be  split  into  teams  of  5  students,  which  will  work  independently from the other teams. Each day, a part of the satellite design  will  be  proposed  and  a  document  of  requirements  will  be  provided.  Each  team has to deliver either a short report or software, and to give a short talk  by the end of the day.     Grading   The evaluation will include a final report, the developed software, and the  final oral presentation. At the end of each session, the teams will also   358      present the results of the day, which will be accounted for in the final  mark.      Course support, bibliography  Course handouts "Guidage et Pilotage d'un Satellite"     Resources   • Document of requirements in an industrial format  • Orbit simulation software, satellite instrumentation software.   • Supervision by Thalès e Alenia Space engineers and CentraleSupélec  Professors     Learning outcomes covered on the course  The main goals are    •  Understand aspects and constraints in satellite design, develop   models for each design stage and understand the dynamical  behavior of the satellite   •  Choose a satellite orbit to satisfy the requirements  •  Design the hardware by choosing sensors, actuators and energy   generators   •  Propose a set of operational modes and the control laws to satisfy   the performance requirements.    Validate each step of the design with simulation (GMAT,  VTS Timeloop,  Matlab/Simulink)    At the end of the module, the participants will have completed the main  steps in the desing of a AOCS : the choice of the orbit, the choice of  harware components and the AOCS architecture as well as the design and  validation of control laws.        Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course    •  Analyze, design and implement complex systems made up of  scientific, technological, social and economic dimensions. (C1)   •  Acquire and develop broad skills in a scientific or academic field and   applied professional areas. (C2)   •  Act, engage, innovate within a scientific and technological   •  Have a sense of value creation for his company and his customers   environment. (C3).   (C4).   •  Be operational, responsible, and innovative in the digital world (C6).  •  Know how to convince (C7).   359
