   2SC5693 - Hybrid aeronautical propulsion   of   will   almost   carried   passengers       Instructors: Antoine Renaud  Department: DOMINANTE - ENERGIE  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 40  On-site hours (HPE): 27,00        Description  The  electrification  of  aviation  is  a  topical  issue,  given  the  challenges  of  reducing  polluting  emissions  to  which  the  air  transport  community  has  committed itself: by the middle of the 21st century, the aim is to halve CO2  emissions  from  all  air  traffic.  At  the  same  time,  it  is  estimated  that  the  volume  double.    In  this  context,  it  is  legitimate  to  focus  on  electrically-powered  aircraft,  which raises the problem of energy storage: batteries are still very heavy and  are barely sufficient to move light aircraft with two passengers over a few  hundred  kilometers.    During this challenge week, we will focus on a light aircraft of the high-end  ultralight  class.  For  this  category  of  aircraft,  we  can  already  consider  electrification of the propulsion with existing technologies. We will consider  a hybrid architecture combining a battery with a hydrogen fuel cell.     Quarter number  ST5     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  Transport phenomena or Electrical energy courses     Syllabus  A general Simulink template of the model will be provided, with a number  of blank sub-templates that will need to be completed. Validation tests will  then have to be carried out on each of the sub-systems.     1. Fuel Cell   •  Battery core electrochemistry  •  Thermal management  •  Sequencing logic   425      2. Electrical distribution and motorization   •  Engine and its regulation  •  Battery and its management system  •  Power regulation   3. Airframe   •  Flight mechanics and taxiing  •  Control loops and piloting   4. Preparation of the test procedure   •  Definition of mission profiles  •  Pre- and post-processing     In a second part, the groups will be redistributed into three teams and the  models of the sub-systems will be shared. Each team will be in charge of  assembling its aircraft and testing it.     Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)  The work will be supervised by speakers from SafranTech as well as  CentraleSupélec teachers. Students will be divided into groups and subgroups according to the different tasks to be accomplished.  Reconfigurations will take place during the week according to the progress  of the work.     Grading  The evaluation is based on attendance, motivation and efficiency  throughout the week as well as on two group presentations, one in the  middle of the week and the second on the last day.      Resources  The whole activity will take place using Matlab/Simulink software to  simulate the problem.     Learning outcomes covered on the course  By the end of the week, students will have learned about flight mechanics,  how to fly an airplane, and how electric motors and fuel cells work. Most  importantly, they will have learned how to manage the constraints  associated with these different elements when they are assembled in a  complex system. Finally, the scope and complexity of the problem  necessarily require teamwork with different core businesses, replicating  real-life work situations.    426        Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course    C1.3: Apply problem-solving through approximation, simulation and  experimentation.  C1.4: Design, detail and corroborate a whole or part of a complex system.  C2.3: Rapidly identify and acquire the new knowledge and skills necessary  in applicable/relevant domains, be they technical, economic or others.  C7.1: Persuade at core value level; to be clear about objectives and  expected results. To apply rigour when it comes to assumptions and  structured undertakings, and in doing so structure and problematise the  ideas themselves. Highlight the added value.  C8.1: Work collaboratively in a team        427
