   2SC5193 - Aircraft design       Instructors: Christopher Betrancourt  Department: DOMINANTE - CONSTRUCTION VILLE TRANSPORTS, DOMINANTE -  GRANDS SYSTÈMES EN INTERACTION  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 40  On-site hours (HPE): 27,00        Description   The  goal  of  this  training  is  to  let  you  discover  the  different  stages  of  an  aircraft design process in both a theoretical and a practical perspective. You  will be introduced to the typical methods used in an aircraft design office,  and  apply  this  knowledge  by  doing  the  preliminary  design  of  your  own  aircraft  After  completing  this  training  course,  you  will  have  acquired  knowledge  and  skills  that  will  enable  you  to  work  out  the  main  aircraft  characteristics and layout in a very short time frame.     Quarter number  ST5     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  Have to follow the elective course "Airplane control".     Syllabus   When  a  team  commits  to  design  a  new  aircraft  or  to  modify  an  existing  aircraft, the project will always follow the same pattern. The process starts  by analyzing the market and existing products. Next is the conceptual design  which is followed by the preliminary design and detail design before sending  the  drawings  to  the  workshop  which  will  build  a  prototype.  Obviously,  at  each stage, several iterations are made as necessary before proceeding to  the next stage. In the process, we will begin by a more global or synthetic  approach of aircraft design before getting into  more and more detail. We  will go from a basic concept into full optimization, from using parameters  derived from simple statistical data to using sophisticated algorithms.      Grading   Evaluation will  take place  the last day  of the  course  and  include  : an  oral  presentation to present your project and followed by a question and answer  session.   363               Resources   Teacher: industrial partner.       Learning outcomes covered on the course   Student will learn how to:  • Define the layout and configuration of the new aircraft.  • Work out estimates for empty weight and maximum take-off weight.  • Compute wing loading.  • Work out estimates for lift and drag ✧ Work out performance estimates  (take-off, climb, cruise, landing).  • Make an analysis of the aircraft's stability and control.  • Compute the applied loads ✧ Select the structural materials.  • Estimate the costs (design, manufacturing, operational).    Of course, the general concepts are not only valid for aircraft design but  can equally be applied to the development of any other conceivable  product or service.       Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course    •  Analyze, design and implement complex systems with scientific,   technological, human and economic components (C1).   •  Develop in-depth skills in a scientific or sectoral field and a family of   •  Act, undertake and innovate in a scientific and technological   professions (C2).   environment (C3).   •  Have a sense of value creation for his company and his customers (C4).  •  Be operational, responsible, and innovative in the digital world (C6).  •  Know how to convince (C7)      364
