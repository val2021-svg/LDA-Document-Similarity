   2SC5610 - Introduction to energy production       Instructors: Maya Hage Hassan, Amir Arzandé  Department: DÉPARTEMENT SYSTÈMES D'ÉNERGIE ÉLECTRIQUE  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 34,50            Description  To reduce energy consumption and polluting emissions it’s necessary to  use energy systems that includes sources whose efficiency and  characteristics are complementary. This is true for electricity generation  systems, where the growth of intermittent renewable generation requires  more flexibility from conventional means of production, and also from the  transport sector, where the electric and thermal powertrains complement  each other advantageously.  These multi-energy systems require advanced control modes to take  advantage of the complementarity of energy sources, and satisfy user  needs and economic, technical and environmental constraints.

Understand different ways of converting thermal energy into mechanical  one (internal combustion engine, turbomachine, nuclear core).   Identify the strengths and constraints of these different modes of energy  production as well as to propose first elements of pre-sizing.  Propose a fast modeling of synchronous and asynchronous machines and  converters and also to identify some machine / converter systems for  hybridization applications, with regards to the electrical portion of the  course.       Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course    Examine problems in their entirety and beyond their immediate  parameters. Identify, formulate and analyse the scientific, economic and  human dimensions of a problem   417      Develop and use appropriate models, choosing the correct modelling scale  and simplifying assumptions when addressing a problem  Apply problem-solving through approximation, simulation and  experimentation. / Solve problems using approximation, simulation and  experimentation  Design, detail and corroborate a whole or part of a complex system  Create knowledge within a scientific paradigm  Master the skillset of a core profession within the engineering sciences (at  junior level)  Be proactive and involved, take initiatives  Act ethically, with integrity and respect for others  Demonstrate rigour and critical thinking in approaching problems from all  angles, be they scientific, social or economic     418
