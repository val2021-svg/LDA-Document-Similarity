2EL5120 - Smart Photonics Systems          Instructors: Delphine Wolfersberger  Department: CAMPUS DE METZ  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE METZ  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Fundamental Sciences  Advanced level : No      Description    In the context of new technologies, light is increasingly used as a support for  calculating, transporting or storing information. The objective of this course  is to present recent developments in "photonics", including lasers and their  applications  in  different  fields:  ultra-fast  optics,  telecommunications,  all  optical information processing.     After a few notions of wave physics, the different types of laser sources will  be  discussed  as  well  as  the  different  components  of  a  typical  optical  information transmission channel: from emitters (LEDs and laser diodes) to  receivers  (photodiodes)  .  A  practical  experiment  on  the  transmission  of  sound  will  be  set-up  to  validate  the  course.  We  will  then  discuss  about  different applications that we carry out in our laboratories using light: chaos  in  lasers,  random  numbers  generation,  holography  for  storing  light,  slow  light... Some visits of labs will be organized to allow students to discover the  world of research and innovation.
