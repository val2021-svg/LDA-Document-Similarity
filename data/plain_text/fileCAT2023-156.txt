   2SC6310 - System Architecture and Modeling   trades,  standards,  but  also       Instructors: Herve Gueguen, Nabil Sadou  Department: CAMPUS DE RENNES  Language of instruction:   Campus: CAMPUS DE RENNES  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 34,50        Description   Modern  systems  are  becoming  more  and  more  complex.  This  complexity  results  from  the  interaction  between  their  components,  the  increase  and  complexity  of  the  exchanged  data,  the  heterogeneity  of  concepts,  substances,  from  human  complexity  (organization, ergonomics, psychology, sociology ...).  To better handle this complexity, it is often necessary to model the different  artifacts  of  the  system.  This  modeling  allows  stakeholders  at  different  phases of the system's life to better understand its objectives, to structure  its architecture, to make analyses to predict its behavior, and thus to make  a  justified  choice  between  alternatives.  The  various  models  constitute  a  reference  system  design.  Thus, the objective of this course is to provide students techniques and tools  for  modeling  and  structuring  system  architectures.  Technological  systems  will be privileged with fields such as avionics, railway, industry, energy, or  health.  Moreover,  the  emphasis  will  be  made  in  identifying  system  performance  attributes  (critical  SPI  system  performance  indicators)  that  need to be monitored to design, implement, operate, or manage complex  systems.

English specific sessions are  also scheduled.     Grading  written exam (1h) (30%) and regular testing (70%)      Resources  lectures, exercises, case study     Learning outcomes covered on the course     By the end of this course, students will be able to :  - Design and implement system modeling (Observe, Define the system,  Propose a formal model, Analyze and Exploit the results)  - Understand the concepts of system structure (components, hierarchies,  and decomposition principles) with a particular focus on the interactions  between the elements of a system (causal or non-causal, synchronous, or  asynchronous, information or energy exchange interfaces, etc.).  - Understand and analyze interactions to accurately organize the  architecture of a system to facilitate its modularity and future evolutions.  - Deploying the various techniques of behavioral modeling of a system to  predict its behavior.       Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course    •  C1.1Examine a problem in full breadth and depth, within and  beyond its immediate parameters, thus understanding it as a  whole. This whole weaves the scientific, economic, and social  dimensions of the problem.    o  C1.1 Study a problem as a whole, the situation as a whole.  Identify, formulate and analyze a problem in its scientific,  economic and human dimensions   o  C1.2Select, use, and develop modeling scales, allowing for  appropriate simplifying hypotheses to be formulated and  applied towards tackling a problem.   •  C8 Leading a project, a team    a. C8.1 Work collaboratively in a team.   491
