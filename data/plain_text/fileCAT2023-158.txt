   ST5 - 64 - MODELLING AND DEVELOPMENT OF   SUPERVISION SOFTWARE   Info&Num  (Informatique  et  Numérique)  et  SCOC  (Systèmes     Dominante :  Communicants et Objets Connectés)  Langue d’enseignement : French  Campus où le cours est proposé : Rennes        Engineering problem   Today, information technology is omnipresent, and in particular allows the  supervision of sensors and connected objects, as well as the processing and  analysis  of  data  from  them.  For  example,  in  the  medical  field,  connected  insulin pumps or pacemakers can be used to collect information in order to  produce  histories,  statistics  on  groups  of  individuals,  etc.  In  the  "smart  building"  context,  the  information  systems  deport,  for  example,  the  management or billing.   The  objective  of  such  a supervision  system  is  on  the  one  hand to  provide  aggregated information to users and supervisors, but also to enable system  regulation by sending control commands to sensors and connected objects.  Thus,  the  software  implementation  of  such  a  system  is  based  on  several  services,  with  multiple  users  manipulating  data  specific  to  their  role.  The  difficulty of such an implementation lies in the modelling and the volume of  data  processed  in  real  time,  but  also  in  the  choice  and  definition  of  the  software  architecture  that  will  allow  to  obtain  an  efficient  system  while  ensuring an easy maintainability.   In this ST, we propose to study the design of such a system. To do this, we  will study on the one hand the modelling and the data management, and on  the  other  hand,  the  design  patterns  that  will  allow  to  accelerate  the  development while facilitating the maintainability of the system. In addition,  the teaching of integration will be the occasion to illustrate the benefits of  an AGILE organisation by allowing to design a functional system as soon as  possible and to make it evolve according to the customer's needs.   Adviced prerequisites   None   Context  and  issue  modules :  The  context  and  issues  modules  of  this  thematic sequence are based on those of the two other thematic sequence  topics proposed on the Rennes campus, "Health" and "Smart Building". The  first  two  workshops  are  therefore  "shared"  with  these  other  thematic  sequences.  Then,  workshops  specific  to  software  development  are   494         presented.  Depending  on  the  availability  of  industrialists,  the  subjects  covered  are  embedded  development,  Lora  networks  and  UML  modelling.  Practical  workshops  on  basic  software  development  tools  (git,  command  line, etc.) complete the lectures given.   Specific course (60 HEE) : Data models and design patterns   -  Brief description : This course allows the students to discover the notions  necessary for the design of software manipulating large quantities of data.  It  approaches  the  object-oriented  programming,  through  two  languages,  Java  and  Kotlin.  It  then  approaches  the  methodologies  of  software  engineering in close connection with the course of system modeling in which  the various diagrams (classes, sequence, etc.) are seen. The course allows  the student to question the relevance of the structuring of a software code  with regard to the existing design patterns. To this end, the tutorials, which  are based on the system modelling course that takes place in parallel, will be  carried out in a reversed pedagogy.   In  a  second  part,  the  course  focuses  on  the  storage  and  manipulation  of  data. It will be a question of discovering the bases of the data base software  and the theoretical problems which that poses (formatting, queries). Finally,  this  part  concludes  with  the  introduction  of  object-relationship  mapping  software which allows to link data with the business code of the application  and for which a particular modelling skill must be acquired.     -   Challenge Week : Development of a sensor monitoring system   -  Associated partner: None directly but some in partnership with other ST5s   on campus  - Location: Rennes campus   -   -   -  Brief  description:  In  collaboration  with  the  students  of  the  thematic  sequences  of  the  Rennes  campus  "Smart  Building"  and  "Health",  the  objective is to develop the information system that will allow to collect and  process  the  data  coming  from  sensors,  and  to  provide  services  for  their  regulation.  The  pedagogical  objective  is  to  discover  the  specificities  of  development in the Cloud and to perceive the interest of design choices to  facilitate software evolution as well as the benefits of an AGILE organisation.   495
