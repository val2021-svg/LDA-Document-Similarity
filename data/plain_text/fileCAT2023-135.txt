   2SC5792 - Design of a cladding : Indoor noise pollution   control       Instructors: Frédéric Magoules  Department: DOMINANTE - MATHÉMATIQUES, DATA SCIENCES  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 40  On-site hours (HPE): 27,00        Description  We focus on the industrial issues that impose the economic constraints and  the technological constraints necessary to improve existing products on the  market, in order to design interior coatings to absorb the noise inside the  buildings  and  also  acoustic  liners  in  jet  engines.  In  this  context  we  are  interested  in three  key applications:  (i)  the  design  of  coatings  in  anechoic  chambers  (until  now  acoustic  anechoic  chambers  have  been  empirically  designed  based  on  geometries  using  different  scales),  (ii)  )  the  design  of  perforated absorbent panels (absorbent materials are fibers that have very  good acoustic absorbency properties, and are usually covered with wooden  panels  for  aesthetic  reasons,  which  unfortunately  hampers  their  effectiveness)  and  finally  (iii)  )  absorbent  insulations  perforated  in  jet  engines. In the last application it is important to optimize the diameter and  positioning of the holes in the material. The objectives are to better control  the waves by analyzing the optimal shape of the surface of these coatings in  order to improve the sound absorption in decibels by taking into account the  stakes and industrial constraints.     Quarter number  ST5     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  The courses of ST5 and in particular the course "Theory and algorithmics  for wave control" (one of two proposed trackes)     Syllabus  issues,  Teamwork  simulated  an  "industrial  company",  definition  of  bibliographic  research,  physical  understanding  and  practical  interest,  mathematical modeling of the problem, development of the corresponding  mathematical  theory  if  necessary  (the  problem  well  or  badly  posed,  regularity of the solution , derivation of acoustic energy with respect to the   440      geometry of the wall, influence of choice of chosen porous material on the  absorption of energy, ...), development / implementation of the numerical  method, numerical analysis of the results , the analysis of their relevance,  possible  improvement,  obtaining  an  effective  shape  for  a  large  band  of  frequencies.     Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)  Teamwork, project, dialogue with various specialists in the field.     Grading  Report, final and intermediate deliverables, defense      Resources   Connection to a cluster at the distance    Students will perform modeling, simulation, visualization and rendering of  the chosen phenomenon. They will study the simulation chain with a goal  of performance and precision under economic constraints (manufacturing  cost) and environmental (gain in decibel or potential).    Deliverables: report, software, transparencies and defense       Learning outcomes covered on the course   -  Understand the contribution of geometry in the design and   development of new products    -  Apprehend the theoretical and numerical techniques of acoustic wave   -   control   Implement numerical methods to simulate acoustic wave propagation  phenomena of large dimensions (internal problems and problems for a  wide band of frequencies)    -  Validate the theoretical and numerical techniques of acoustic wave   control    -  Confront students with the realization of a complex product by   numerical simulation techniques      Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course     C4.1 Thinking customer. Identify / analyze the needs, issues and constraints  of other stakeholders, including societal and socio-economic: study of  industrial, psychoacoustic and environmental interest for the  determination of the constraints of the control problem.     C6.1 Identify and use the software necessary for his work on a daily basis  (including collaborative work tools). Adapt your "digital behavior" to the   441      context: use and development of a numerical code based on the existing  parts.     C7.1 Convince on the merits. Be clear about the objectives and the  expected results. Be rigorous about the assumptions and the approach.  Structure your ideas and your argumentation. Highlight the created value.  To convince while working on the relation to the other: by working in team  the strategic choice is crucial to have good results of the project, to do it it  is necessary to be able to convince the others; teamwork itself; the final  defense before a multi-disciplinary jury.      442
