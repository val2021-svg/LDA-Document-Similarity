   2SC6210 - High energy performance communications       Instructors: Yves Louet  Department: CAMPUS DE RENNES  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE RENNES  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 34,50      Description   ICT (Information and Communication Technologies including base stations,  data centers, user equipment’s, etc.) field is responsible of 6 to 10% of the  worldwide  electrical  consumption  what  corresponds  to  4%  of  the  greenhouse gases emissions. With an early growth of 7% especially with the  coming 5G and the expected increase of billions of connected “things”, it is  urgent  to  reduce  this  footprint  by  finding  new  ways  of  transmitting,  processing and saving data. That is to say spectral efficiency (ie transmit the  maximum data in a given bandwidth) have to be joined with the objectives  to increasing the energy efficiency of the links.  To do so the milestones of this courses are:     •  Make the audience aware of the ICT footprint  •  Explain with is power consuming in ICT and where are the potential   gains   •  Draw the communications chain (transmitter, channel, receiver)   with the key parameters which come into play (bandwidth, data bit  rate, power, link budget, etc.). Explain the role of the key  components (coding, modulation, filtering, etc.).    •  Put in light one of the most dimensional factor : constant or noconstant envelope signal Continuous Phase Modulation (CPM)  modulation format with constant envelope (MSK, GMSK, FSK,  OQPSK, ….) and their associated receivers   •  The associated standards (mobile communications, Bluetooth, IoT,   aeronautical communications, etc.).    •  compare the linear and non linear modulations      Quarter number  ST5     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)   Most of the prerequisites of this course fit with the topics covered in the  1A course entitled "Signal Processing" (1CC4000). In particular :   •  deterministic modelisation of signals   479        Syllabus   •  power, energy, correlation  •  Fourier transform and spectral representation of signals  •  spectral analysis  •  filtering and convolution  •  sampling of signals and aliasing  •  Discrete Fourier Transform   1.

Symbol to signal coding : waveform filtering : intersymbol  interferences  c. Spectrum density  d. Examples of standards   3. Linear modulations    a. CPM (FSK, MSK, GMSK, OQPSK, etc.)  b. Receivers architectures  c. Examples of standards    4. Comparison between linear / non linear modulations    a. Spectrum sefficiency  b. Energy efficiency  c. Bit error rate performance on AWGN channel      Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)   Regarding the HPE (Heures Présentiel Elèves), the course is divided into  three part:   •  18 hours of lectures  •  4,5 hours of tutorials classes  •  10,5 hours of laboratory classes   Furthermore, 25,5 hours of personnal works are scheduled. This course will  be evaluated by a 1,5 hours exam. The Professors are Yves Louët (head of  the course), Haïfa Fares and Georgios Ropokis.    All lectures will be given in french with specificities for students who have a  low level in french : all documents will be in english and tutorial classes,  laboratory classes and the "enseignement d'intégration" will be given in  english. Additional hours as tutoring in english will be scheduled.    480         Grading   This course will be evaluated by :a score related to laboratory classes  reports (weighted 0.2) and a score of a 1h30 exam duration (weighted 0.8)    Competencies 1 and 2 will be evaluated in the introduction (stakes and  context) and in the specific course  Competencies 4, 6 and 7 will be evaluated during the final defense related  to the integrated courses.
