   2SC5293 - Advanced supervision of biogas production   from waste       Instructors: Cristian-Felipe Puentes Mancipe  Department: DOMINANTE - VIVANT, SANTÉ, ENVIRONNEMENT, DOMINANTE - GRANDS  SYSTÈMES EN INTERACTION  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 40  On-site hours (HPE): 27,00        Description   Anaerobic  digestion  is  a  natural  process  of  degradation  of  organic  substances  by  micro-organisms  (bacteria  and  archaea)  in  the  absence  of  oxygen (anaerobic conditions).   This process makes it possible to recover a fraction of the energy contained  in the waste in the form of biogas, a mixture of methane and CO2.   The  widespread  use  of  these  technologies  would  on  the  one  hand  considerably reduce the energy demand necessary to treat waste (10% of  the energy used on the planet) but could in the long term constitute a source  of energy.    However, the anaerobic digestion process is complex and involves several  hundred  species  of  microorganisms.  Moreover,  is  unstable,  and  intermediate compounds (volatile fatty acids) can, under certain conditions,  accumulate and lead to the total shutdown of the reactor. To avoid this, very  precise and costly monitoring is necessary.    The objective of the Challenge Week is to propose and develop monitoring  and  control  strategies  to  reduce  the  risk  of  reactor  acidification  and  to  optimize energy production from waste.     Quarter number  ST5     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  There are no specific prerequisites.     Syllabus    Students will first need to understand an anaerobic digestion model that  will be provided and simulate it for different conditions.  In particular, they will need to simulate reactor acidification under  conditions of overloading the reactor.    it   381      They  must  propose  a  simulator  with  a  simplified  model  for  this  complex  system, for the purpose of implementing control and estimation strategies.  In  a  second  step,  they  will  have  to  develop  observers  to  evaluate  certain  intermediate compounds, and in particular volatile fatty acids. It is desirable  that a self-calibration dynamic is introduced to take into account the  slow  drifts of certain model parameters.  Other  groups  will  use  the  models  to  develop  control  strategies.  Different  approaches will be implemented (e.g. PID, feedback control).  In the end, a supervisor will be proposed by associating an observer(s) to a  control law. The performances of the different supervisors will be compared  for different reactor operating scenarios.     Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)  Students  will  be  divided  into  groups.  The  project  will  be  carried  out  by  organizing the internal work of each group in order to address the different  themes of the specifications.  Analytical and numerical tools will have to be developed by the students in  order to address the problems raised.  The hypotheses and data considered must be questioned; these  elements  will lead the students to iterate on their design choices in order to obtain  relevant solutions.     Grading  The evaluation will include a continuous assessent, a final report, and an  oral presentation.

Learning outcomes covered on the course    At the end of the Challenge Week, the students will be able to:   •  Model a bioprocess for the culture of a microorganism for   environmental application   •   Design software sensors to reconstruct variables not available   online   •      Design control laws to maintain the system at desired operating  conditions (pH, temperature, concentrations, etc.) to maximize the  productivity of the bioprocess.   •      Analyse the proposed solution (including economic analysis and   ecological footprint) and be critical of the results obtained.         Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course  -    C1.1, Analyze: study a system as a whole, the situation as a whole.  Identify, formulate and analyze a system within a transdisciplinary  approach with its scientific, economic, human dimensions, etc. Milestone 1  -    C1.2, Modeling: using and developing the appropriate models, choosing  the correct modeling scale and the relevant simplifying assumptions.  Milestone 2  -    C2.3, Identify and independently acquire new knowledge and skills.  Milestone 2  -    C4.2, Propose one or more solutions answering the question rephrased  in terms of value creation and complemented by the impact on other  stakeholders and by taking into account other dimensions. Quantify the  value created by these solutions. Arbitrate between possible solutions.  Milestone 1  -    C7.1, Basically: Structure ideas and arguments, be synthetic  (assumptions, objectives, expected results, approach, and value created).  Milestone 2  -    C7.2, On the relationship with others: Understand the needs and  expectations of his interlocutors evolutionarily. Encourage interactions, be  a teacher, and create a climate of trust. Milestone 2        383
