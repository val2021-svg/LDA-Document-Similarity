Learning outcomes covered on the course  The subject aims to introduce the fundamental concepts of financial risk  management to students, and in particular the corresponding  mathematical aspects. This module will allow the students to be familiar  with stochastic models of asset pricing, to discover common derivative  products and to address real issues of risk management.   504
