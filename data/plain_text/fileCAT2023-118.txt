   2SC5310 - Architecture and technology of the   autonomous vehicle       Instructors: Caroline Lelandais Perrault  Department: DÉPARTEMENT ÉLECTRONIQUE ET ÉLECTROMAGNÉTISME  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 34,50          Description  The objective of this course is to familiarize students with the architectures  and technologies used for the autonomous and connected vehicle (ACV)  and their means of development.   To do this, it is necessary to define what is a mobility system in which the  vehicle is embedded and then to understand the functional architecture of  the ACV. As the functions of the ACV are essentially composed of electrical  and electronic systems, the electrical and electronic hardware architecture  is presented as well as its specificities and constraints due to the  environment in which the automobile operates. Also at the hardware level,  intelligent sensors and real-time embedded aspects of processing are  studied. At the processing level, traditional or more advanced control laws,  image processing and artificial intelligence are discussed. At the  communication level, the "vehicle-to-vehicle/vehicle-to-infrastructure"  (V2X) technologies, the associated protocols, the characteristics and  constraints of the communication channels for the application are studied.  Finally, at the level of vehicle validation, the development process as it is  carried out by manufacturers is presented.     Quarter number  ST5     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  To follow this thematic sequence, it is recommended to have taken one of  the SPI courses in Electronic Systems (two occurrences in SG1 and two  occurrences in SG3) and one of the SPI courses in Networks and Security  (one occurrence in SG1 and two occurrences in SG3). The Modeling course  given in ST2 is also a prerequisite.      388        Syllabus    I Mobility system and embedded electronics   · Definition of the mobility system (infrastructure/vehicle) and  architecture of the autonomous and connected vehicle (perception,  processing, communication, actuation, and propulsion and energy  conversion)  · AD/ADAS development process  · The electrical and electronic architecture of the vehicle (power  supply network, ECUs, communications bus)  · Hardware specificities in automotive electronics (physico-chemical  environment, EMC, reliability, card manufacturing process,  operating safety)  · Intelligent sensors (LIDAR, RADAR, cameras, smart sensors)   II On-board algorithms and processing   · Control laws for the autonomous vehicle (LQR, Kalman filtering,  neural networks, fuzzy logic...)  · Artificial intelligence for autonomous vehicles  III Communication of the vehicle with its environment   · V2X Technologies  · Channel access, traffic, and performance   Note: this outline does not reflect precisely the chronology of the course     Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)    15 HPE of lectures + 18 HPE of practical work    Grading  The final exam for the specific course will be a 1.5 hour written exam and  assess skills C1 and C6. Some practical work will also be evaluated and  contribute to the evaluation of skill C6.      Resources    The courses will be taught by CentraleSupélec professors and by industrial  experts from automotive manufacturer or automotive electronics  companies.     Learning outcomes covered on the course     At  the  end  of  this  course,  the  student  will  be  able  to  understand  the  electrical  and  electronic  architecture  of  an  autonomous  and  connected  vehicle  and  the  communication  technologies  between  the  vehicle  and  its  environment.  The  student  will  be  able  to  model  and  simulate  a  vehicle  communicating  at  the  functional  and  physical  level  by  detailing  the  constraints and limitations related to the environment and technologies.     389           Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course     C1 : Analyze, design and build complex systems with scientific,  technological, human and economic components  C6 : Be operational, responsible and innovative in the digital world   390
