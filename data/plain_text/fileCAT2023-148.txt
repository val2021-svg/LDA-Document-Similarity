   ST5 - 61 - SMART PHOTONICS SYSTEMS    FOR CONTROL AND MEASURE     Dominante :  PNT (Physics and NanoTechnology), SCOC (Communicating Systems  and Connected Objects)  Langue d’enseignement : English  Campus où le cours est proposé : Metz        Engineering problem   Systems using photonics - science and technology exploiting light - allow to  measure,  regulate  and  control  physical  quantities.  These  properties  of  photonic systems are widely used in the regulation of a laser for production  systems, in the control of the deflection of a beam to visualize an object or  observe the dynamics of biological cells, or in the stabilization of ultra-short  pulses in telecommunications. In addition, photonic systems are intelligent  systems whose measurements are used to facilitate regulation, for example  with  the  development  of  telemetry  and  laser  velocimetry  -  techniques  widely used in industrial production and in our vehicles, and essential for the  industry of the future and the autonomous vehicle.   Very  recently,  photonic  systems  have  undergone  a  revolution  in  their  principle and their use with the development of systems that exploit light at  the  nanometer  and  attosecond  scales.  These  innovative  systems  by  their  new physics pose important challenges for both the measurement of their  physical properties - given the very short spatial and temporal scales - and  the exploitation of this measurement for the development of sensors and  innovative  control  systems,  given  the  limitations  of  our  signal  processing  systems. By studying photonic systems, this thematic sequence will also be  an  opportunity  to  learn  and  master  the  general  notions  of  analysis,  identification and control of non-linear physical systems.   Adviced prerequisites   Basic  knowledge  of  electromagnetism,  materials,  general  electricity  and  electronics   Context  and  issue  modules:  This  part  is  structured  in  conferences,  round  table and visit of the GDI SIMULATION site - Elancourt, in particular around  the theme of "laser remote sensing".   Specific course (60 HEE) : Photonics for the control of physical systems   Brief  description:  This  course  will  teach  the  essential  concepts  of  measurement  and  exploitation  of  physical  quantities  of  optical   470      electromagnetic waves, in the context of the exploitation of photonics for  the  observation  and  control  of  physical  systems.  Thus  this  course  will  assemble knowledge of:  -  Optical  measurement and  instrumentation:  general  metrology  and  error  analysis,  photometry,  and  optical  detectors,  holographic  metrology,  velocimetry, interferometry.  -  Laser  source  semiconductors.  - Modeling and control of sources: analysis and non-linear dynamics of laser  sources.  - Optical signal generation: techniques for spatial and temporal modulation  of optical signals; engineering and design of optical beams.   technologies:  solid  state  physics,  materials  and   The concepts covered in the course are :  - Optical metrology  -  Photonic  technologies  including  semiconductor  materials  and  optical  fibers, phase and intensity modulation  - Signal analysis using the non-linear dynamics of a physical system  - Properties and control of non-linear systems   Challenge Week : Laser remote sensing (LIDAR) for optronic surveillance and  target detection   Associated partner: GDI SIMULATION - Elancourt   - Location: Metz campus   - Brief description : This EI is based on the use of lasers as tools to control  the  infinitely  small  and  the  ultra  fast  for,  in  particular,  applications  in  the  field of optronic surveillance and target detection. It is proposed to develop  a photonic system whose target application is laser ranging (LIDAR). These  lidars  have  a  huge  potential  for  defense,  environment,  security:  identification of mobiles, gas detection, active imaging ... The detection and  identification of danger or targets is a key element of defense and security  devices, and are key elements for example of the devices developed by GDI  SIMULATION for civil aviation or the simulation of laser fire for the training  of armed forces. The students will perform the experimental realization of  the LIDAR using ARDUINO plat-forms. They will have: i/ to understand the  essential physical quantities related to an optical electromagnetic wave ii/  design and realize a servo-driven photonic system iii/ engineer and control  innovative  optical  beams  by  exploiting  spatial  and  temporal  signal  modulation techniques v/ make a choice of devices to answer an economic  problem of sizing and energy consumption.   Recent advances in the realization of innovative optical beams will also allow  the  exploration  of new beam  topologies  (e.g. Airy  beams: non-diffracting,  curvilinear trajectory, self-regenerating in case of obstacles) which open the  way to improved performances (spatial resolution, speed, etc.).    471
