   2SC6292 - Remote control of thermal comfort       Instructors: Haïfa Jridi  Department: DOMINANTE - GRANDS SYSTÈMES EN INTERACTION, DOMINANTE -  SYSTÈMES COMMUNICANTS ET OBJETS CONNECTÉS  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE RENNES  Workload (HEE): 40  On-site hours (HPE): 27,00        Description  This teaching aims to use the knowledge achieved through the courses of  the ST "Energy intelligence and intelligent buildings" to design an automatic  remote control system of thermal comfort in a multi-zone space therefore  with different considerations and resources.      Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  - High energy-efficient communications   - Energy intelligence and smart buildings        Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)   - Teamwork (brainstorming)  - Harmonization of tasks and tools used:   * Simulink for simulations  * GNU-Radio for real transmission emulation   - Definition of needs and performance indicators  - preparation of deliverables       Grading  The final mark includes an evaluation of the individual contribution (work in  subgroups  and  involvement)  and  a  collective  evaluation  (deliverables,  intermediate technical validations, final presentation). A penalty of - 2 pts is  applied per half-day of absence.      Resources  - Teaching team for supervision: Romain Bourdais and Haïfa Farès.  - Software tools: MatLab and GNU-Radio for simulations  - Hardware tools: USRP modules for real transmissions to be configured  using GNU-Radio.  - Lab rooms    486        Learning outcomes covered on the course  - Design a multi-zone thermal comfort regulation system that works  remotely  - Introduction to Software Defined Radio   - Realization of the wireless communication between the building and the  controller   - Considerations on the trade-off between the use of the wireless  communication protocol and the quality of service of the control       Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course  Skills developed: C1.4, C4.2, C6.1 and C7.1.        487
