   2SC5110 - Performance and flight paths       Instructors: Sihem Tebbani  Department: DÉPARTEMENT MÉCANIQUE ENERGÉTIQUE PROCÉDÉS  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 34,50              Description  The course provides the skills and knowledge needed to model and control flying  vehicles  (in  and  out  of  the  atmosphere)  to  improve  system  performance.  It  is  divided into two parts.     The first part of this course is a core curriculum whose objectives are to provide a  common basis of knowledge and skills. This common core is organized into three  parts.  First,  solid  mechanics  is  introduced  to  give  the  necessary  tools  for  the  modeling of airplanes, launchers, satellites, UAVs... In a second step, the course  describes  the  dynamics  and  control  strategies  of  an  aircraft.  Finally,  space  mechanics  is  introduced  to  give  the  necessary  tools  to  describe  movement,  disturbances, and maneuvers of a spacecraft.     The objectives of the second part of the course are to provide new knowledge and  skills to reinforce those seen in the core curriculum of this course. It will focus on  the design and control of three systems: an aircraft, a launcher, and a satellite. It  will provide specific knowledge and skills necessary for the topics of the challenge  week.     Numerous experts in aeronautics and aerospace fields are involved in this course.           Quarter number    ST5     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)    There is no specific prerequisites.    353        Syllabus     Core curriculum:        1. General mechanics :   This course will provide the basic notions in solid mechanics. It will address  the following points:     •      Equation of motion of a rigid body. Fundamental Principles of Dynamics   •      Tutorial 1: Measurement of the parameters of inertia of a mricosatellite.     •      Mechanical linkage between rigid bodies.      •      Tutorial 2: movement of a Cubli.    •      Aerospace actuators (stability of rotation around the main axis of inertia,   gyroscopic effect, application to gyroscopic actuators, reaction wheels).       •     TD 3: attitude of a satellite          2. Flight Mechanics :     This part of the course will illustrate the  dynamic stability through the stability  study  of  an  airplane  in  flight.  The  objective  is  to  identify  the  movements  induced by small disturbances around a state of equilibrium and to determine  the  damping  or  the  amplification  of  these  movements  according  to  the  properties of the aircraft. The lecture part gives all the mathematical modeling  tools that will be used in the stabilization study.  It will address the following  points:    •         Definition of Euler angles. Matrix formulation       •       Linearized dynamic equations of motion     •       Solving linearized equations       •       Presentation of the representative modes: phugoid, incidence oscillation,   Dutch roll, Roll subsidence mode and spiral divergence.     3. Space mechanics    This course introduces the fundamentals of space mechanics, focusing on the  study of free motion in gravity field, orbital manoeuvres and space  environmental perturbations. Some insights on inter-planetary missions are  given.   Elective course (One course depending on the chosen topic of the challenge  week)   In the second part of the course, three courses are proposed, corresponding to  an introduction to the projects of the challenge week.      354      1. Control of an airplane     This course aims to detail the modeling and control of an airplane. It will  address the following points:     •      Presentation of the specification for the flight performance of an airplane        •      Modeling forces acting on the aircraft (including thrust, lift and drag)       •       Coefficients and ratio for the study of the trajectory performance.           2.  Control of a launcher      The course aims to address the fundamentals of attitude control of a  launcher, in both propelled and ballistic phases. The requirements to be met  by the control system as well as the physical disturbances to be managed  during the flight will be addressed. Command synthesis principles will be  presented, as well as aspects relating to the actuators.           3. Control of a satellite   This course aims to detail the modeling and control of a satellite. It will  address the following points:    •      Architecture of a AOCS   •       Typical missions, families of AOCS, types of orbits, disturbing couples,   •        Sensors and actuators for a satellite   •      control modes and algorithms, contribution of the AOCS    •      Specifications for a AOCS system (stability, performance, robustness,   different developped controllers).            Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)   Lectures and tutorials.   Several examples of real aircraft and aerospace systems will be presented.       Grading  The specific course will be evaluated individually by a final examination lasting 1  hour 30 minutes. This evaluation will be done by MCQ. Ten questions per section  on the first part of the course (core curriculum), i.e., 30 questions in total. These  questions can include small exercises of application.
