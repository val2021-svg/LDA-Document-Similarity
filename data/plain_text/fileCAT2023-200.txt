   2SC8192 - Optimization of parts for biomedical  applications in polymer additive manufacturing       Instructors: Elsa Vennat, Camille Gandiolle  Department: DOMINANTE - CONSTRUCTION VILLE TRANSPORTS  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 80  On-site hours (HPE): 48,00          Description   Optimization of a training box for medical application designed entirely in  additive manufacturing. Topics may concern the design of the assembly,  the measurement chain, the optimization of the material of artificial organs  (ultrasound impression) ...       Quarter number  ST7     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)   To have completed the “continuum mechanic” SPI course and at least one  of the following courses: Materials, Transport phenomena,  Thermodynamics.       Syllabus  The students will be divided into teams of 5 maximum. Each team will have  to optimize the design of a polymer part subjected to complex mechanical  or multiphysical loads by integrating that the process must be additive  manufacturing. The topics may concern the materials of artificial organs or  the system in which they are installed.    step 1 : Getting to know the subject  step 2 : Simplified representation of the studied part to reach a first  optimum on a first field of parameters.  step 3 : Optimization of the system in a new parameter space closer to the  real system modeled by advanced methods.  step 4 : Analysis of the cost benefits of the proposed solution compared to  the classical solution, e.g. manufacturing time, cost of materials,  manpower used, environmental compatibility...   616        Most topics involve finite element simulation on COMSOL or the software  of the students' choice. Some topics may involve experimental work.      Grading  C2 and C8 skills will be evaluated throughout the project, which will end  with a defense in the presence of the industrial partner. Competencies C2  and C7 will be evaluated during the defense. The partner will evaluate the  C4 competence.  Continuous assessment during the project (C2, C8) : N1  Teachers' grade for the oral defense (C2, C7) : N2  Industrial partners' mark (C2, C4, C7) : N3  NF = 30%N1 +30%N2 + 40%N3        Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course  C2 Develop an in-depth competence in an engineering field  and in a family of professions  C4 Have a sense of creating value for your company and your clients  C7 Know how to convince  C8 Lead a project, a team  617
