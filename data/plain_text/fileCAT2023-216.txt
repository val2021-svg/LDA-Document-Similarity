   2IN5010 - Bridge Building challenge       Instructors: Guillaume Puel  Department: DÉPARTEMENT MÉCANIQUE ENERGÉTIQUE PROCÉDÉS  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 40  On-site hours (HPE): 27,00  Elective Category : Engineering Sciences  Advanced level : Yes      Description  The principle of this experimental teaching is to build, according to a given  set of specifications, a cardboard bridge model capable of supporting the  greatest possible load. The main objective is to highlight the interactions  between modelling, experimentation and numerical simulation.     Quarter number  Intensive week  of the SG6 and at the end of the SG8     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)   1EL5000 (Continuum mechanics) or 1EL4000 (Materials) or ST2 CVT  (Performance modelling and hybridization in the preliminary design phase)  or ST4 CVT (Digital transformation and integrated engineering: digital  model and life cycle of structures and vehicles)     Syllabus    •  Monday, all day (in parallel):    o  Characterization of the mechanical properties of the   cardboard    ▪  tensile tests on cardboard specimens cut in different   directions to determine the moduli of elasticity,  Poisson's ratio (using marker tracking) and tensile  strengths (each group offers two different specimens  and thus contributes to the realization of a collective  experimental basis)   o  Brainstorming on the possible architectures for the bridge    i.  use of topological optimization software (TopOpt)  ii.  study of first simple models with Comsol   •  Tuesday, all day (in parallel):     o  Structural tests    ▪  compression tests on "profiled" beams  ▪  tensile tests on beams assembled by gluing   654      ▪  (possibly) tests of various assemblies   o  Design of bridge models    ▪  precise design of bridges using finer numerical   models on Comsol and structural tests   •  Wednesday, all day (in parallel):    o  Construction of bridge models (laser cutting of the designed   o  Complementary numerical models (or additional   parts at la Fabrique)   experimental tests)   o  Preparation of the next morning's presentations   •  Thursday :    o  Morning: presentation of the different models    ▪  every group of students must announce the load that   their model will be able to support   ▪  the groups also vote for the model they think will win   o  Afternoon (for those who can): test of bridge models in a   "challenge" configuration, open to the public   •  Friday:    o  Morning: analysis of test results and interpretation of   discrepancies with predictions   o  Afternoon: writing of a summary note on the learning of the   activity     Grading  work within the project + intermediate defense + final summary note.       Resources    •  Software: Comsol (Structural Mechanics module)  •  Equipment-specific classrooms: LMPS laboratory (Matter block of   Eiffel building)    Learning outcomes covered on the course   At the end of this course, students will be able to:   •  conduct tests for the mechanical characterization of a material or   structure    o  experimentally determine the mechanical properties of a   material for use in a real structure   o  conduct tests on real structures to evaluate their mechanical   performance   •  dimension a structure from a mechanical point of view   o  propose models, analytical or numerical, and of increasing   complexity, of real structures   655      o  obtain, using these models, relevant quantities to make   design choices   •  present in a convincing and reasoned way a mechanical design   approach   o  present the modeling choices and the results resulting from   a mechanical dimensioning   o  explain the differences in performance of the actual   structure with respect to the developed model(s)        Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course   The validation of the milestones 2 of competences C1, C2 and C8 are  assessed individually throughout the week, as well as in the Intermediate  Defense and the Final Briefing Note from a team point of view.   656
