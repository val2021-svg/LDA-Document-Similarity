2SC7810 - Renewable energies and micro grids          Instructors: Pierre Haessig, Nabil Sadou  Department: CAMPUS DE RENNES  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE RENNES  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 34,50        Description    Faced  with  the negative  environmental  impacts of  any  energy  production  and the depletion of fossil resources, the transition to renewable sources is  a  profound  trend.  While  renewable  energies  provided  only  25%  of  the  world’s electricity production in 2018, this share is growing rapidly, with a  threefold increase over 10 years in wind and solar energy.   These new energies raise specific questions to be addressed in this course:   •  What are the wind and solar resources and the main principles of   their conversion into electricity?   •  What are the storage technologies, in particular batteries, that can   manage the variability of these sources?   •  What are the technical, environmental and economic challenges of   these technologies?   In  addition,  wind  and  solar  energy  are  much  more  decentralized  than  conventional thermal power plants. Thus, electricity production is moving  closer to consumption areas, which leads to the emergence of the notion of  “microgrid”, similar to short food supply chains (SFSCs).   A  microgrid  is  a  small  electrical  system  that  integrates  production  and  consumption within a delimited area (building, district, island, etc.) and is  equipped with a local energy flow management system. A microgrid can be  stand-alone or connected to a large network. If connected, it acts as a unique  and intelligent actor, able, for example, to buy electricity from the wholesale  market at the best moments or to provide grid services. The integration of  all these components and functions raises system optimization issues that  are covered in this course.   Due  to  their  small  size,  the  issue  of  reliability  is  an  important  one  for  microgrids.  This  course  aims  to  study  the  methods  of  dependability  to  analyze the risks of failure, plan maintenance and react to outages…   580           Quarter number  ST7     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  None     Syllabus   Renewable energies (REn) and storage :    •   Solar, wind, hydroelectric, bio-mass,...  •   Modeling and predictability of production  •   flexibility, storage technologies   Micro grids :    Reliability of grids:   •  Reliability indicies  •  Security bdies  •  Reconfigurability  •  Failure and reliability of components   Economic models of micro grids:    •  Investment plan, profitability  •  Uncertainties and risk management  •  Energy markets, price signal, trading   •  Electrical grid architecture and modeling  •  Sizing and operational management: taking into account the impacts   of renewable energies, Quality of Service (voltage, frequency, etc.)        Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)  Lecture (~50%):  Exercise/labs (~50%)     Grading  written examination 1h30 - (70%) continuous assessment  (30%)      Resources   lecture, labs.
