   2EL5010 - Introduction to mobile applications   engineering       Instructors: Virginie Galtier  Department: CAMPUS DE METZ  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE METZ  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Fundamental Sciences  Advanced level : Yes        Description    Because of their ease of use and their ability to follow us everywhere, mobile  devices  (phones,  tablets)  have  become  first-class  terminals  and  many  companies have made the shift from "web-first" to "mobile-first" strategy.     This course focuses on the development phase of a mobile application, after  the specification of its functionalities and before its possible publication on  a  store.  Two  main  strategies  will  be  presented:  web  applications,  with  limited functionalities usable on both Android and iOS, native applications,  more  powerful  but  requiring  specific  developments.  A  wide  part  of  this  course  is  dedicated  to  concrete  work,  on  Android  to  illustrate  the  development  of  native  mobile  apps,  and  with  Ionic  and  Angular  (for  example)  to  illustrate  the  development  of  reactive  web  site.  Optionally,  students will also learn about securing Android applications.    The knowledge and know-how acquired during this course may be useful in  some curriculum-assigned projects, or in campus associations or enterprise  activities.     Quarter number  SG6     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  1CC1000 -Information Systems and Programming     Syllabus  Introduction    •  Overview of mobile application development strategies  •  Basics of Object Oriented Programming in Java   242      Android application development    •  Android system overview  •  Development tools  •  Design and implementation of applications based on Activities,   Layouts and Intents   Introduction to web application development    •  Basics of HTML5, JavaScript and CSS  •  Design and implementation of a simple web application   Depending on progress: Introduction to Android applications security    •  Presentation of common vulnerabilities  •  Protection mechanisms      Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)   The structure "6 labs + 16 lectures" is administrative because the course is  actually mostly composed of "learning by doing" sessions led by teachers  and industrial experts. The introduction to the security of android  applications will take the form of an escape game.       Grading   The skills acquired by the student during the course will be evaluated on  the basis of a final individual written test (1/2), and the development and  presentation with a fellow student of a personal Android application with  some imposed elements (1/2).   Re-take exam: 20-minute oral exam + new project with a predefined  description, to be carried out individually      Course support, bibliography    •  Head First Android Development.
