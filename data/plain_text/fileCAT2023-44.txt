   2EL1840 - Advanced Mechanics for Civil Engineering:   "Building tomorrow"       Instructors: Brice Bossan  Department: DÉPARTEMENT MÉCANIQUE ENERGÉTIQUE PROCÉDÉS  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Engineering Sciences  Advanced level : Yes      Description   The  aim  is  to  materialize  a  project  for  a  construction  in  the  future,  and  therefore to simultaneously exercise innovation and scientific skills, and also  to work in project mode ...   Through this problematic posed by a constrained and different environment  from that of the Earth today, students develop their innovation capacities  and  acquire  skills  in  Civil  Engineering,  Materials,  Thermal,  Construction  &  Logistics, and also Environmental...   As the tutorials are done in sub-groups, students acquire skills in teamwork,  transdisciplinary  scientific  communication during project reviews and the final defense.       Quarter number  SG6      Syllabus   Session 1 (3h): launching lecture, constitution of the 4 project groups,  commented bibliography in 4 groups of 25 students.  Sessions 2 and 3 (4 times 1.5h): 4 thematic conferences followed by Q&A  with students  Sessions 4, 6, 8, 10 (4 times 3 hours): tutorials in 4 groups of 25 students  (working in parallel) with a science facilitator present for each group. The  scientist then gives the theoretical and applied lessons that the students  need to progress in their work.  Sessions 5, 7, 9 11 (4 times 3 hours): alternating with sessions 4, 6, 8 and  10, the project review (carried for each group) allows the students to  measure the progress of the work on all the themes, to make coherent  choices and to record what they have learned, then to identify the locks to  be lifted for the good continuation of the work they will do in TD, and in  personal work.   project  management,   reporting   and   147      Session 12: restitution of the work via a presentation in the lecture hall of  the 4 groups of 25 as well as a synthesis of the solution by the 4  rapporteurs of the 4 groups. The evaluation of the students is done by the  course leaders + the scientific and innovation facilitators.        Grading  The individual evaluation of the students is done "continuously" by the  Scientist during the TD/TP, that of the group is done during sessions 5-7-911 and 12.     Resources   Teaching staff: B.Bossan is responsible for the organization of the elective.  Each theme is piloted by a scientist.  Size of the TDs: 4 groups of 25 students        Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course  C2 Develop in-depth skills in an engineering field and a family of process.  C7 Know how to covince. C8 Lead a project, a team.  148
