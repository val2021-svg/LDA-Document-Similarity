   2SL8100 - Project S8       Instructors: Laurent Bourgois  Department: DÉPARTEMENT DÉVELOPPEMENT PROFESSIONNEL ET MÉTIERS DE  L'INGÉNIEUR  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS, ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE METZ, CAMPUS DE RENNES, CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 200  On-site hours (HPE): 96,00          Description   A project is a collective work modality used to apprehend complex open  problems. Its effectiveness depends on the individual skills of each person  and on the team's operating practices; the objective being to produce a  final product for a client in a given time. The projects proposed in the  engineering training program allow students to learn this modality by  putting them in increasingly complex situations. The projects must lead to  an ambitious achievement, which could not be reached by redoing what  we already know how to do.       Quarter number  ST7 and SG8     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)   Project management, API workshops       Syllabus  The projects run from February to June. They follow the usual phases of a  project:  * Define and frame the project  * Program the actions  * Define roles and responsibilities  * Measure progress and proceed to feedback loops  * Develop technical and organizational skills  * Communicate your achievements  * Capitalize on the experience gained     Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)  As the project progresses, there are many and varied interactions with the  project environment. It is based on individual and collective actions. There   54      will be (1) collective times at the level of the cluster for the transmission of  good practices and knowledge, (2) personal work to be defined within the  group, (3) collective work to align and manage the project group. The  supervisors will monitor the project regularly to ensure that no blockages  appear and to validate the steps taken.       Grading   The evaluation covers the ongoing participation during the year, the quality  of the written report and the oral presentations made during the project.  These contributions will be viewed from four different angles: involvement,  content and deliverables, communication, and team functioning in project  mode.  Milestones will be achieved in competencies C3, C4, C7, C8 and C9  throughout the project.      Resources   Projects are carried out by groups of 5 students. Each project is attached to  a cluster where projects of the same nature are grouped together. The  clusters provide supervision and software and hardware resources. At the  beginning of the year, the clusters are presented at a Project Forum.  Students can ask to join a cluster. They can also propose to carry out a  personal project with a team that will be hosted in a cluster. All students  participate in an online assignment campaign. The cluster leaders help  select the most motivated students.       Learning outcomes covered on the course  At the end of this teaching, the student will be able to:  * summarize personal action within a project  * produce a high value-added deliverable in conjunction with various  stakeholders  * organize a team to produce an original, valuable solution to a complex  problem  * anticipate the human, social and environmental consequences of its  actions, and determine the scope of your responsibilities  * prepare clear and rigorous communication about the project's  achievements and operation       Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course   Milestones will be achieved in the following competencies throughout the  project:  * C3 - Act, undertake, innovate in a scientific and technological  environment  * C4 - Have a sense of creating value for your company and your  customers  * C7 - Knowing how to convince   55      * C8 - Leading a project, a team  * C9 - Think and act as an ethical, responsible and honest engineer, taking  into account environmental, social and societal dimensions  Depending on the nature of the project, competencies C1, C2, C5 and C6  may also be targeted.   56
