   2SC5691 - Regulation and control of energy production   and conversion systems       Instructors: Guillaume Sandou  Department: DOMINANTE - ENERGIE  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 40  On-site hours (HPE): 27,00        Description   This "Challenging Week" entitled "Energy production and conversion" aims  to tackle the regulation issues of several electrical energy production units,  linked to the transport or distribution network. The considered systems to  be studied will be for instance (list to be confirmed when the project  subjects will be available) an hydroelectric production unit, a wind farm, a  cogeneration or a photovolatic production unit.  The work to be done will be divided into few main steps:  - development of a model of the energy production unit based on given  documents and data  - design of a control law for the production unit in face with specifications  well suited to the considered problem  - Validation based on simulations of the regulation law.  These studied will be partly carried out in collaboration with EDF and in  particular with the "Centre d'Ingénierie Hydraulique" located in Bourgetdu-Lac.  Depending on the considered case, the work will consist in reproducing the  observed behaviour of the controlled production unit, enhancing the  performance of the regulation, or investigating an innovative operating  mode for the production unit.
