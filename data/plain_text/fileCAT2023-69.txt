   2EL2620 - Mobile communication networks and services      Instructors: Mohamad Assaad  Department: DÉPARTEMENT SIGNAL, INFORMATION, COMMUNICATION  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Engineering Sciences  Advanced level : No      Description    Communication  networks  have  been  widely  developed  and  spread  across  the globe in less than half a century. Due to the emergence of new concepts  and services (smart cities, industry 4.0, Internet of Things, etc.), networks  are in great (r) evolution, especially with the development of 5G, to support  the transformation of many so-called vertical sectors (telecommunications,  transport, energy, health, agriculture, industry ...). Various types of services  are thus transmitted over wireless networks nowadays.    The objective of this course is to understand the architectures of the current  networks and to provide a prospective vision of their evolutions, as well as  the  cellular  concept  and  the main  radio techniques used  to transmit  data  over  wireless  networks.  This  course  presents  also  the  theoretical  foundations  and  tools  used  for  the  design,  optimization,  deployment  and  management  of  communication  systems  and  networks.  It  addresses  the  dimensioning of a network and the determination of its coverage in practice,  as  well  as  the  link  between  the  capacity  of  a  network  and  the  quality  of  service to be offered to each user, using traffic engineering tools.

Learning  outcomes 3 and 5 lead to the achievement of milestone 1 of competence  C1.2, i.e. "Know how to use a model presented in class in a relevant way".  Selecting simplifying hypotheses that are appropriate to the problem at  hand".  Learning outcome 5 also leads to the achievement of milestone 2B  of competency C1.3, i.e., "Knowing the limitations of numerical simulations  and what can be expected from them, knowing how to criticize the results  of numerical simulations.   228
