            ST5 - 57 - CONTROL OF ACOUSTIC AND   ELECTROMAGNETIC POLLUTION   Dominante : MDS (Mathematics, Data Science) and Info&Num (Computer Science  and Digital)   Langue d’enseignement : French   Campus où le cours est proposé : Paris-Saclay      Engineering problem   Noise  pollution  is  nowadays  considered  as  a  major  annoyance  by  the  population,  while  electromagnetic  pollution  raises  many  questions  and  interrogations related to health problems. The practical realizations allowing  to control this pollution represent a technical and industrial challenge of the  first  rank,  but  do  not  yet  benefit  from  the  new  developments  that  mathematical analysis, numerical simulation and data processing can bring.   This  course  focuses  on  the  design  of  innovative  products  (acoustic  or  electromagnetic  coatings)  intended  to  control  acoustic/electromagnetic  pollution. Having introduced the physical context, it aims to give students  the mathematical and computer science notions associated with the design  and  manufacture  of  such  products.  This  teaching  proposes  two  paths  of  training:    1.  Mathematical Methods Track: a track based on mathematical theory  (PDEs,  functional  analysis,  Fréchet  derivative)  associated  with  numerical  algorithms to master the control of waves to define the shape of an acoustic  or electromagnetic coating. In particular, in this track are treated the PDEs  on irregular edges (fractals) and is developed the method of optimization of  shapes and the notion of the derivative with respect to the edge.   2.  Scientific  Computing,  numerical  methods  and  algorithms:  the  objective  of  this  track  is  to  deepen  the  numerical  methods  used  in  the  mathematical track, it is oriented towards scientific computing. By focusing  on the same common goal as the mathematical track, this track allows to go  further in the numerical implementation of the method of optimization of  forms.    Both  tracks  study  methods  (theoretical  or  numerical)  that  are  useful  for  controlling  external  acoustic  waves  (in  the  vicinity  of  highways,  airports,   428            construction sites) or internal acoustic waves (sound insulation in offices by  perforated panels or acoustic liners in aircraft engines for example), as well  as for controlling electromagnetic pollution (anechoic chambers).   The  integration  course  allows  students  to  apply  the  skills  and  knowledge  acquired  in  the  case  of  a  chosen  application  to  guarantee  the  best  performance  while  taking  into  account  regulatory,  environmental  and  economic constraints.   The  intervention  of  industrialists  (ONERA,  SIEPEL)  and  specialists  in  the  design  of  anti-noise  walls  allows  a  better  understanding  of  the  economic  constraints  and  issues  associated  with  the  design  and  operation  of  innovative products.   Adviced prerequisites   For the "Mathematical Methods" track, mastery of the first year PDE course  is  required.  From  a  general  point  of  view,  having  followed  the  SPI  course  "Physics of Waves" would be a plus.   Context  and  issue  modules: This  part  is  organized  around  half-days  of  training  aimed  at  presenting  the  sequence,  the  integration  teaching  and  introducing the issues and associated locks. Thus, the following topics will  be  addressed:  fractals  for  innovation  in  acoustic  and  electromagnetic  applications,  control  by  acoustic  liners  in  aeronautical  engines,  current  challenges in the control of electromagnetic waves, research and innovation  in the control of waves.   Specific course (60 HEE) : Wave control: theory and algorithmic   Brief description: The two proposed tracks have the same objectives. The  concepts of the common course of Automatic are deepened in the context  of the control of the dissipation of the energy of a wave. The observability in  this case depends on the geometry of the absorbing edge. To illustrate the  reasons  why  geometric  irregularity  is  needed,  the  notions  of  fractal  geometry  are  introduced  with  results  known  in  physics  and,  for  the  theoretical way, in mathematics. In particular, we present the phenomena  of localization and absorption of waves (acoustic or electromagnetic) which  are linked by the spectral analysis of the model (theoretical and numerical).  In order to better understand the environmental and sociological stakes of  the  development  of  acoustic  barriers,  some  psycho-acoustic  aspects  are  presented,  which  show  the  importance  of  the  dissipation  of  certain  frequencies.  The  course  studies  in  particular,  for  a  fixed  frequency,  the  obtaining  of  an  optimal  form  for  a  frequency  model  via  the  Helmholtz   429            equations  with  the  aim  of  allowing  its  use  in  AR  on  two  types  of  control:  geometric and topological. For the numerical path, the algorithmic part of  this  method  will  be  presented  in  detail.  In  the  mathematical  path,  these  numerical methods will also be presented but much more briefly.   We then consider the main difficulty of having a "near optimal" shape over  a large frequency band, important from a psycho-acoustic point of view and  from  industrial  interests.  The  final  goal  in  AR  is  to  be  able  to  quickly  and  robustly  determine  the  optimal  or  "near  optimal"  shape  of  the  geometry  over a frequency band by numerical simulation.   The  two  proposed  tracks  include  a  joint  numerical  project  on  eigenmode  localization and two different examination topics.   Challenge week n°1: Design of a cladding to control wave pollution Control  of external acoustic pollution   - Associated partner: ONERA   - Location: Paris-Saclay campus   Brief description : We position ourselves on the industrial issues that impose  economic  constraints  and  technological  constraints  necessary  for  the  improvement  of  existing  products  on  the  market,  to  design  innovative  coatings  to  absorb  noise  from  aircraft,  trains,  cars.  The  aim  is  to  develop  these innovative products in an optimal way by controlling the energy of the  waves  through  the  geometry  of  the  wall  while  taking  into  account  the  economic  constraints.  For  example,  COLAS  and  École  Polytechnique  have  developed a noise barrier called "Fractal Wall" TM, which was empirically  designed with a complex geometry to dissipate the different wavelengths.  However, this wall, even if it is four times more efficient than conventional  walls for low frequencies, is hardly sold... The explanation lies in the fact that  its  construction,  being  done  by  demolding,  risks  breaking  the  wall,  which  results  in  a  high  manufacturing  cost.  This  AR  proposes  to  find,  by  wave  control methods, optimal shapes as absorbent as possible (in decibel) which  satisfy the constraints imposed by the industrialist, for example, the lowest  manufacturing  cost  with  the  highest  decibel  reduction.  First  numerical  results  in  this  context  show  the  existence  of  optimal  shapes  "not  too  complex" able to improve by a factor of 6 the performances of the "Fractal  wall" TM.   430         Challenge week n°2 : Design of a cladding to control wave pollution. Control  of indoor acoustic pollution   - Associated partner: ONERA   - Location: Paris-Saclay campus   - Brief description : We are positioned on the industrial issues that impose  economic  constraints  and  technological  constraints  necessary  to  improve  existing  products  on  the  market,  in  order  to  design  interior  coatings  to  absorb noise inside buildings and also acoustic liners in aircraft engines. In  this context we are interested in three main applications: (i) the design of  liners in anechoic chambers (so far acoustic anechoic chambers have been  designed  empirically  based  on  geometries  using  different  scales),  (ii)  the  design  of  perforated  absorbing  panels  (absorbing  materials  are  made  of  fibers  that  have  very  good  absorbing  acoustic  properties,  and  are  usually  covered  with  wooden  panels  for  aesthetic  reasons,  which  unfortunately  impairs their effectiveness) and finally (iii) perforated absorbing insulators in  aircraft  engines.  In  the  last  application  it  is  important  to  optimize  the  diameter and positioning of the holes in the material. The objectives are to  control the waves as well as possible by an analysis of the optimal shape of  the surface of these coatings in order to improve the acoustic absorption in  decibel by taking into account the industrial stakes and constraints.   Challenge week n°3: Design of a coating to control wave pollution. Control  of electromagnetic pollution   - Associated partner: ONERA   - Location: Paris-Saclay campus   -  Brief  description  :  We  position  ourselves  on  the  industrial  stakes,  presented  by  SIEPEL,  which  impose  the  economic  and  technological  constraints  necessary  to  improve  the  existing  products  on  the  market,  in  order to absorb the electromagnetic waves. As fields of application, we aim  at the design and the optimization of an anechoic chamber. We notice that  the  absorbing  materials for  electromagnetic waves  are  different  from  the  dissipative materials for acoustic waves. The different nature of these waves  implies an adaptation of the model seen in class.   431
