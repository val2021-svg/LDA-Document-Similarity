   2SC6190 - Laser remote sensing (LIDAR) for optronic   surveillance and target detection       Instructors: Delphine Wolfersberger  Department: DOMINANTE - PHYSIQUE ET NANOTECHNOLOGIES  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE METZ  Workload (HEE): 40  On-site hours (HPE): 27,00      Description   This EI is based on the use of lasers as tools to control the infinitely small and  the  ultra-fast  for,  in  particular,  applications  in  the  field  of  optronic  surveillance  and  target detection.  It  is  proposed  to develop  an innovative  control-command solution for the generation of ultrashort laser pulses and  the  implementation  of  a  photonic  system  whose  intended  application  is  laser telemetry (LIDAR: laser radar). These "lidars" have enormous potential  for defense, the environment, security: mobile identification, gas detection,  active imaging, ... The detection and identification of danger or targets is a  key element of the defense and security systems , and are key elements for  example devices developed by GDI Simulation for civil aviation or simulation  of laser shooting for the training of the armed forces.     Quarter number  ST5     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)   None     Syllabus   The students will be divided into different groups each performing 4  practical works.  Practical Work Proposal:   1 / a session on the emitting laser: realization and characterization of a  laser transmitter regulated in temperature so as to maintain its constant  power  2 / a session on the generation of a laser pulse: study of the generation  of a laser pulse via the use of an optical feedback loop  3 / a session on the shaping of the laser beam: shaping of the laser  beam via the appropriate optics and / or via the use of a spatial light  modulator (SLM) allowing ultimately the use of beams not Conventional  (ex bundles of Airy)  4 / a session on the receiver: development of the device for receiving  and analyzing the optical signal   474         These 4 sessions will be followed by a session on the synthesis of the  different experiments for the realization of a telemetry device and possibly  the development of the servo system necessary for the laser signal to  reach the target.     Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)   Experimental and digital realization in team in the form of a challenge     Grading   Oral presentation in front of CS professors and industrial partner GDI  Simulation        Resources   optical set-ups  Pedagogical Team : Delphine Wolfersberger - Nicolas Marsal        Learning outcomes covered on the course    The students will perform the experimental realization of the LIDAR using  ARDUINO plat-forms. They will have:    i/ to understand the essential physical quantities related to an optical  electromagnetic wave    ii/ design and realize a servo-driven photonic system    iii/ engineer and control innovative optical beams by exploiting spatial  and temporal signal modulation techniques    iv/ make a choice of devices to answer an economic problem of sizing  and energy consumption.   Recent advances in the realization of innovative optical beams will also  allow the exploration of new beam topologies (e.g. Airy beams: nondiffracting, curvilinear trajectory, self-regenerating in case of obstacles)  which open the way to improved performances (spatial resolution, speed,  etc.).
