   2SC6090 - Building inspection by a semi-autonomous   drone (quadricopter)       Instructors: Jeremy Fix, Herve Frezza-Buet  Department: DOMINANTE - MATHÉMATIQUES, DATA SCIENCES  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE METZ  Workload (HEE): 40  On-site hours (HPE): 27,00      Description   The students will work on issues related to the technical inspection of indoor  environments by UAVs (visual and thermal diagnosis). They will thus provide  answers to needs in terms of improving energy performance and detecting  possible damage, in particular allowing significant savings for the considered  sites.   During this week of practicals, the focus is on helping a human operator by  automating drone control as much as possible and providing the operator  with  a  high  level  of  logical  control.  The  students  will  have  implemented  servoing techniques with the particularity of including a human operator in  the  control  loop.  They  will  also  have  integrated  machine  learning  and  pattern recognition techniques for the interpretation of information flows  from the embedded sensors (mainly video). This is a first contact, through  the application and experimental side, with the field of machine learning.  Through  this  experience,  they  will  have  acquired  a  more  general  competence in the design of robotic systems with ROS.  Warning: One of the major achievement of the sequence is the experimental  validation on real quadrotors in the corridors and gymnasium of the school.  This requires you to master several tools (ROS, Linux, ...) and skills in Python  programming.  A  lot  of  work  and  a  real  motivation  are  required  from  the  students; The volume of the ST5 and the availability of the teaching staff are  reinforced to help you to achieve these goals.      Quarter number  ST5     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  Students should be comfortable with Linux/Ubuntu, ROS and OpenCV.  These prerequisites will be taught during the thematic sequence with  which this practical is associated.     Syllabus   The practical is divided into three main modules. The first module deals with  1)  the  low  level  control  loop  regulating  roll/pitch  angles  and  upward  and   468      rotational  speeds  and  2)  some  higher  level  controls  (U-turn,  translation  along an axis). The second module focuses on the management over time of  direct  behaviors  (linear/angular  speeds)  and  logical  behaviors  (taking  the  door to the left, moving into the corridor). The third module includes all the  image processing functionalities (detection of vanishing lines, calculation of  optical  flow,  etc.).  These  three  modules  are  further  divided  with  a  finer  granularity so that the students can parallelize the work.        Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)   - Presentation of case studies by industrial partners  - Designing solutions to proposed problems  - Development of proposed solutions in a real environment  - Implementation on real drones and possible adjustment of solutions  - Presentation/Demonstration of solutions to industrial partners      Grading  Individual and group work will be assessed during the EI period, for  competency C6. The oral presentation of each group at the end of the EI on  the problem introduced by a company will assess competences C4 and C7.
