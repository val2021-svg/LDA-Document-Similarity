   2EL1560 - Models and Systems for Big Data   management       Instructors: Nacera Seghouani  Department: DÉPARTEMENT INFORMATIQUE  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Fundamental Sciences  Advanced level : Yes        Description   Existing  data  management  technologies  continue  to  evolve  and  adapt  to  challenges related to the heterogeneity, the volume and the velocity of data.  NoSQL  (Not  only  SQL)  databases  are  a  family  of  DataBase  Management  Systems  (DBMS)  which  differs  from  the  traditional  relational  SGBD  paradigm.  The  purpose  of  such  DBMSs  is  the  simplicity  of  design,  the  horizontal scaling, the real-time access, the availability and performance in  a distributed infrastructure.    The objective of Models and Systems for Big Data Management course is to  study the theoretical foundations, the conceptual models and technologies  for storing, monitoring and querying big data. From SQL to NoSQL, NoSQL  the  data  representation  models,  the  data  querying  and  analytics,  the  performance measures in a distributed environnement are the main aspects  addressed in this course.       Quarter number  SG6     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  Basic knowledge of relational databases and SQL query language.  Desired basic knowledge of client/server architecture.     Syllabus    1.  Conceptual models for data representation: SQL (relational) and   NoSQL (document, key-value, column, graph).   2.  Data querying and analytics languages.   3.  Transaction concepts, ACID properties, CAP theorem.  4.  Main concepts related to data distribution in a cluster.    115      5.  Practical works on data modeling, querying real data (social   network data, Wikipedia, ...).   6.  Softwares : Oracle/postgres, Cassandra, Neo4J, Giraph,   ElasticSearch.        Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)   The course is organized as follows:    •  12 slots of 1h30 of lecturer,   •  5 slots of 3h practical/lab works, groups of 25 students (maximum).        Grading  Continuous assessment during practical/lab work classes, project, written  exam (2h):   50% written exam,   30% project (last lab),  and 20% continuous assessment (quizzes related to labs, 2 best marks).        Resources  Slides, practical exercices/works and solutions, QCMs, bibliography  references.  Use of different data management system softwares available on  MyDocker.     Learning outcomes covered on the course   At the end of this course, students will be able to:    •  choose a data management model which fits with the application   and the data nature.   •  define, deploy, manipulate a SQL and NoSQL database.  •  acquire the fundamental concepts underlying distributed data.        Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course   C1.2 Develop and use appropriate models, choosing the correct modelling  scale and simplifying assumptions when addressing a problem  C6.4 Solve problems through mastery of computational thinking skills.  C6.5 Operate all types of data, structured or unstructured, including big  data.   116
