   2EL1410 - Heat Transfer       Instructors: Benoît Goyeau, Gabi-Daniel Stancu  Department: DÉPARTEMENT MÉCANIQUE ENERGÉTIQUE PROCÉDÉS  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS, ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Engineering Sciences  Advanced level : Yes      Description   Heat  transfer  covers  broad  scientific  and  technical  domains.  The  field  of  application  of  this  discipline  is  characterized,  among  other  things,  by  considerable spatial and temporal scales: from the nanometer (thematic of  the heat transfer at nano-scale) to interstellar distances (astrophysics), from  the  femtosecond  (thermal  response  of  a  ultra-short  laser)  to  the  characteristic  time  of  the  genesis  of  the  universe  (thermal  evolution  of  stars).  Heat  transfer  concerns  also  society  subjects  and  major  challenges  such  as  energy  (energy  optimization  of  industrial  processes,  thermal  insulation  of  buildings,  ...),  environment  (global  warming,  atmospheric  greenhouse effect, etc.) or transport (optimization of thermal engines, fuel  cells  and  hydrogen  sector,  ...).  It  is  inherently  a  discipline  in  which  the  physical phenomena are of very different natures, coexist and are coupled.    This course develops and extends the concepts of heat transfer introduced  in  the  courses  "Transport  phenomena"  and  "Modeling  and  simulation  of  unsteady  heat  transfer".  Furthermore,  the  emphasis  here  is  on  the  achievement  of  basic  notions  (via  simple  exercises  -  EAI)  and  on  the  techniques of physical modeling of the heat transfer (via synthesis problems-  PbS).    Domain interests:  Design, master and control any system or process in any field where heat  transfers appear such as residential and tertiary housing, transport, industry,  energy production, etc.. Some universe sciences (meteorology, geophysics,  ...) as well as the environmental sciences also rely partly on the control of  heat transfers.    Teaching objective:  Address the main heat transfer modes in simple cases. This scientific training  is  intended  for  future  generalist  engineers,  a  priori  not  specialists  in  the  discipline.  This  is  a  basic  teaching  of:  steady  and  unsteady  conduction;  radiation  between  opaque  bodies  in  a  transparent  environment;  forced,  natural,   90      It   and   unclear   solution   involves   solving  concrete   (confrontation  with   laminar  and  turbulent  convection  (phenomenological  approach).The  treatment  of  exercises  and problems during  tutorials  is  an  opportunity to  apply  the  knowledge  introduced  during  lectures  and  to  develop  simple  energy  balance  models.  industrial,  environmental  or  metrological  problems  (using  an  inductive  approach).  Using  simple  examples,  some  exercises  of  a  didactic  character  introduce  fundamental notions in heat transfer. Synthesis problems are proposed at  the end of the course. In these, the main difficulty is to build the thread of  the  uncertain).  In  addition,  many  exercises  are  treated  in  the  course  book.  They  are  an  excellent training.     Quarter number  SG6 and SG8     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  Ideally,  the  students  have  taken  the  courses  "Transport  Phenomena"  (elective course 1A, SG1or SG3) and "Modeling and simulation of unsteady  heat transfer" ( specific course in energy  1A, ST2). However, students who  have not taken the two courses will be able to follow this elective but they  will have, before the sessions, to work the courses that are available on the  E-learning platform "E-SELF-LEARNING".

Grading  The first two learning outcomes constitute the minimum level of  knowledge expected for any student who has taken this course. They will  be evaluated during the course by short multiple-choice tests. These  unrated tests will allow students to self-assess and teachers to measure the  level of understanding of some fundamental notions and to detail the  difficult points. Regarding the modeling activity of thermal systems, it is a  complex skill to acquire. Students will learn this progressively during  tutorials classes. The last session of the teaching will be an opportunity to  consolidate all the modeling achievements. The learning outcomes will be  assessed in the final exam (2H), which will consist of two parts. The first  will focus on the assessment of the first two learning outcomes. In the  second, students will be subjected to a complex modeling problem in order  to evaluate the learning outcome modeling of thermal systems.  The core skill C1.2 is validated if the student accomplishes at least 50% of  the part 2 of the final exam. The core skill C2.1 is validated if the student  accomplishes at least 50% of the part 1 of the final exam. The final grade is  the average of the grades of the two parts of the exam.
