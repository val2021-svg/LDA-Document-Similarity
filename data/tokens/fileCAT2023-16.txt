                                   SCIENCE COURSES FOR ENGINEERS   59      2EL0010 - Teaching assistant       Instructors: Mehdi Ayouz, Philippe Bouafia  Department: DÉPARTEMENT MATHÉMATIQUES  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS, ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Business Sciences  Advanced level : Yes      Description   Teaching Assistant Physics: this course consists of tutoring and  supporting  first  year  students  in  their  Quantum  and  Statistical  Physics  course.  It  is  a  great opportunity to learn about teaching for a potential teaching career or  to  apply  for  Teaching  Assistant  positions  in  famous  North  American  universities.  The  objective  is  that  you  learn  how  to  (i)  pass  on  your  knowledge and understanding to a non-expert audience, and (ii) accompany  a  student  in  his  or  her  progress  towards  a  validation  of  knowledge  and  understanding of the Quantum Mechanics course.    Teaching assistant Mathematics: this course consists of giving reinforcement  and support to pre-selected 1st year students in their CIP-EDP Mathematics  course. Introductory workshops on pedagogy complete this course. You will  have  an  enriching  personal  experience  helping  your  fellow  first-year  students  and  you  will  experience  the  cultural  differences  in  mathematics  teaching.  In  addition,  you  will  be  part  of  the  teaching  staff  of  the  mathematics  department  for  a  period  of  time  and  will  be  able  to  have  privileged exchanges with the teacher-researchers. Finally, you will be able  to  develop  the  acquisition  of  pedagogical  and  persuasive  skills  as  a  differentiating  feature  of  your  training.  In  particular,  if  you  wish  to  do  a  double degree in an American or British university, you will be able to use  this  experience  to  obtain  one  or  more  teaching  assistantships  and  be  partially or totally exempt from tuition fees.       Quarter number  SG6 and SG8      Syllabus   Teaching Assistant for Physics: an introductory course will give the  necessary elements for the construction of teaching objectives, the  construction of qcms and the notions of scripting and pedagogical  alignment. However, the majority of this course is do-it-yourself. You will   60      be paired with a group of about 15 first year students with potential  difficulties as they come from non-classical backgrounds. There will be nine  1h30 sessions, each session focusing on a chapter of the Quantum and  Statistical Mechanics course. For each session, a pair of students will carry  out the "reinforcement" tutorials developed for this purpose. The pair will  participate in upgrading the tutorials based on feedback from previous  year by defining the pedagogical learning objectives. They will realize a  qcm for testing these pedagogical objectives. The 1h30 session will be  dedicated to the correction of reinforcement tutorials with their assigned  group. They will be asked to focus on the points of difficulty encountered  to help the progression of the 1st year students.  Teaching Assistant in Mathematics: a kick-off meeting will bring together  the Teaching Assistants and the supervising teachers in order to present  the year's activities, their objectives and their organisation. Pairs or triples  of Teaching Assistants will supervise ten or so first-year students  throughout the year and will have a referent teacher to guide them in this  activity. Each Enhanced Modality session will be preceded by a briefing  with the referring professor, the TAs will propose their plan for the session  in a summary sheet, and a debriefing will take place after the session.  Workshops planned throughout the year will allow you to learn about  pedagogy.       Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)   Teaching Assistant in Physics: Introductory course and simulation (pair  ensuring 9 classes of 1h30 with a total of 15 first year students, upgrade  the existing tutorials, design of qcm).  Teaching Assistant in Mathematics: Pairs or trinomials of Teaching  Assistants will supervise about ten first year students throughout the year  and will have a referent teacher to guide them in this activity. Each  Enhanced Modality session will be preceded by a briefing with the teacher,  the TAs will propose their plan for the session in a summary sheet, and a  debriefing will take place after the session.      Please note: it is not possible to be a Teaching Assistant in Physics AND  Maths, but only in one or the other.       Grading   Teaching assistant in Physics: you will be assessed in pairs on your  contribution to tutorials, qcm constructed and on the animation of a  lesson.    Teaching assistant in Mathematics: you will be assessed on the pedagogical  and scientific qualities of your lessons, and on the rigour and discipline in   61      the follow-up of the scheme (preparation of briefings, debriefs) and the  follow-up of 1A students.         Learning outcomes covered on the course   Teaching Assistant Physics: at the end of this course, students will be able  to (1) set up a grid of pedagogical objectives, (2) create a qcm type  assessment adapted to the pedagogical learning objectives, and (3) script  and lead a session in front of a class of about fifteen students, and use  digital tools (in particular the teaching platform: http://prdmecaqu.centralesupelec.fr/) allowing the student-user to carry out his own  numerical experiments in order to better represent the core concepts of  quantum mechanics. Pedagogical and supervisory skills and persuasive  skills are also acquired skills targeted by this course (C5.1, C7.2, C7.3 and  C7.4).
