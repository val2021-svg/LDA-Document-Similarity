   2EL2610 - Communications Theory   information  exchanged  has       Instructors: Sheng Yang  Department: DÉPARTEMENT SIGNAL, INFORMATION, COMMUNICATION  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Engineering Sciences  Advanced level : Yes      Description   Communication is a fundamental need in all our societies. The ever-evolving  communication networks and the emerging Internet of Things have become  a decisive transforming factor in a large number of industrial sectors (e.g.,  telecommunications,  multimedia,  space  exploration,  surveillance,  control,  navigation, transport,  health,  agriculture,  construction,  environment).  The  amount  of  increased  dramatically,  and  connectivity is becoming ubiquitous thanks to technological innovations and  advanced processing. There are many new challenges: record-breaking high  throughput  and  long-distance  optical  fiber  channels,  ultra-reliable  lowlatency  mobile  links  for  critical  missions,  reliable  connection  between  billions of energy-efficient objects, exploding traffic of multimedia content  delivery, outer space exploration ... The communication theory allows for a  deep understanding of the fundamental limits of a communication system  and  how  existing  algorithms  works,  and  more  importantly,  lays  down  the  foundation for future engineers to solve the unknown use cases.    In  this  course,  we  focus  on  the  general  point-to-point  communication  system  consisting  of  a  source,  a  transmitter,  a  channel,  a  receiver,  and  a  destination. The student will learn the mathematical tools and methods to  model,  analyze,  design,  and  optimize  the  key  components  of  a  communication  chain.  First  notions  of  information  theory  will  allow  the  student to understand the minimum number of bits needed to describe a  given  source  losslessly,  as  well  as  the  maximum  number  of  bits  that  the  transmitter  can  communicate  reliably  with  the  receiver  through  a  noisy  channel for a given resource (e.g., time, bandwidth, power). This course also  aims at providing a methodology to conceive a communication system with  practical  constraints  due  to  technological  or  regulatory  limitations  (e.g.,  reliability, latency, energy efficiency, spectral efficiency, complexity, storage  capacity, cost, consumption).
