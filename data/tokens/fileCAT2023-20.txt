   2EL1210 - Exposure of people to electromagnetism and   electromagnetic compatibility       Instructors: Dominique Lecointe  Department: DÉPARTEMENT ÉLECTRONIQUE ET ÉLECTROMAGNÉTISME  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Engineering Sciences  Advanced level : No      Description    Maxwell's theory has been a source of innovation and technological  progress for more than a century and it is remarkable to note the extent of  the industrial sectors impacted by the applications of this theory:   - the telecommunications sector at the heart of the information society,  - the aeronautics, automobile and transport sector,  - the electrical energy sector,  - the defense and security sector,  - the health and environment sector,  - the building and public works sector,  - the internet and connected objects sector.   Unfortunately, these successes and technological advances are not without  compensation. The electromagnetic pollution generated by all these  electrical and electronic systems has become one of the societal challenges  of the 21st century. Potential victims of this pollution are electronic  systems (electromagnetic compatibility) and people (exposure). Control of  this pollution is the goal of electromagnetic compatibility and exposure of  people to electromagnetic waves. The engineer faces a scientific but also  economic challenge to meet this challenge.    Quarter number  SG6     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  none     Syllabus    1.

These different learning outcomes validate milestones  1 and 2 in skill C1,  milestones 1 and 2 in skill C2.       Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course    These different learning outcomes enable the validation of milestones 1  and 2 of competency C1: Analyzing, designing and building complex  systems with scientific, technological, human and economic components.  These different learning outcomes make it possible to validate milestones 1  and 2 of competence C2: Develop in-depth competence in an engineering  field and in a family of professions.   78
