   2EL1420 - Fluid Mechanics       Instructors: Ronan Vicquelin  Department: DÉPARTEMENT MÉCANIQUE ENERGÉTIQUE PROCÉDÉS  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Engineering Sciences  Advanced level : Yes      Description   The  Fluid  Mechanics  course  extends  the  fundamental  notions,  equations,  and skills previously established during the course Sciences des Transferts on  transport phenomena to a mastery of the various complexities of fluid flows,  their  dynamics,  and  systems  whose  properties  are  governed  by  fluid  mechanics. The course allows for reaching a confirmed level in this discipline  and the corresponding applications before considering more advanced and  specialized studies. The course and practice sessions take into account the  recent  evolutions  of  the  field  by  combining  experimental,  numerical,  and  theoretical approaches to train to engineer practices and future stakes (data  analysis, modeling, simulations, measurements).     The course consists of three blocks. The first one deepens the fundamental  notions through theoretical tools, processing, and analysis of experimental  and  numerical  data.  A  second  block  is  dedicated  to  the  analysis  of  compressible flows in different regimes (subsonic, supersonic, shock waves),  thus allowing to address a vast field of applications previously out of reach  when  considering  incompressible  flows.  Finally,  students  are  invited  to  choose  the  theme  of  their  third  block  in  order  to  briefly  open  to  a  specialization  among  Aerodynamics,  Meteorological  and  climatic  flows,  Aeronautical  and  space  propulsion,  Energy  systems,  Environment,  Hypersonics ...        Quarter number  SG6     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)   The course follows a previous one entitled Sciences des Transferts /  Transport Phenomena. Students enrolled in this course must already be  familiar with fundamental concepts and skills in fluid mechanics:   95      •  Dimensional analysis  •  Local and macroscopic balance equations for mass, species,   •  Evolution of different fields (velocity, pressure, temperature) and   momentum and energy   their interactions   •  Determination of stresses, forces, powers, efficiencies, head losses  •  Boundary layer        Syllabus     Block #1: Advanced Fluid Mechanics (4 sessions)   •  Session 1: Fundamental equations and potential flows   •  Session 2: Analytical solutions et exact profile in boundary layers   •  Session 3: Macroscopic balances and jump conditions through   interfaces    •  Session 4: Instabilities and Turbulence   Block #2: Compressible flows (4 sessions)   •  Session 5: Gas dynamics - Isentropic flows   •  Session 6: Critical conditions and isentropic efficiencies   •  Session 7: Shock waves   •  Session 8: Oblique shock wave and nozzle flows    Block #3: Thematic specialization (three sessions)   •  Choice between different themes such as Aerodynamics,   Meteorological and climatic flows, Aeronautical and space  propulsion, Hypersonics, Energy systems, ...        Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)   11-course sessions: 3h00 each (1h30 of lecture followed by 1h30 of  practice for sessions in blocks 1 and 2) :   •  8 lectures,   •  8 problem-solving workshop sessions.  •  Continuous assessment with a knowledge test at the 4th and 5th   session,   •  3 sessions in thematic blocks  •  a final written test lasting 2 hours.  •  preparation of a poster by groups of students for the evaluation of   the thematic blocks   96           Grading     3 assessments through the different blocks:  Block 1 (20%) : tests (2 x 15 min.) of knowledge   The purpose of the knowledge tests during sessions n°4 and n°5 is to verify  the notions acquired during the first block of the course. The student  obtains a CA grade out of 20. Attendance to these tests is mandatory.   Block 2 (50%): supervised written test during the last class period   The final written test lasts 2 hours. In absolute terms, all the elements of  the course outside the thematic block are included in the program. In  practice, the subject will be mainly related to the content of block n°2  linked to compressible flows. The test is carried out with any authorized  written document. The student obtains a CF grade out of 20.   Block 3 (30%) : preparation of a poster   The evaluation of the thematic block concerns a specific project started  during the session on a technical and scientific subject related to the  studied theme. The approach and the results of the project are reported  through the preparation of a poster. The student obtains a CB grade out of  20 based on four criteria:     •  CB.1: Form, clarity and structure  •  CB.2 : Poster understandable for a person outside the work  •  CB.3: Quality of the study  •  CB.4: Importance of the personal work   The final score is the rounded score obtained after applying the formula:  NF = 0.5 x CF + 0.3 x CB + 0.2 x CA             Learning outcomes covered on the course     At the end of the course, the student will be able to:   •  Model complex systems, a necessary step to their conception and   optimization:    o  Make approximations et estimations,  o  Simplify an apparently complex system  o  Use fundamental balances to solve practical problems   •  Characterize a system involving fluid flows thanks to several   perspectives: simplified analytical solutions, results from numerical  simulations, experimental data.    •  Apply these skills to complex flow (unsteady, compressible)   97      •  Face another disciplinary or application field related to fluid   mechanics to show a rather autonomous adaptation to a new  context         Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course     Core skills in CentraSupélec curriculum:    The course allows the students to validate the C1, C2 and C7 skills in the  engineering curriculum.  C1 is validated if CF >=10.  C2 is validated if NF>=10 and CB >= 12.  C7 is validated if 0.5 x ( CB.1 + CB.2 ) >= 14.   98
