   2EL2230 - Maintenance and Industry 4.0       Instructors: Anne BARROS  Department: DÉPARTEMENT GÉNIE INDUSTRIEL ET OPÉRATIONS  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Business Sciences  Advanced level : Yes      Description   This  course  provides  a  solid  culture  on  the  concepts,  methods  and  tools  involved in the implementation of a predictive maintenance approach.   Predictive maintenance is one of the pillars of Industry 4.0. It is based on the  use  of  data  collected  online,  their  processing  and  their  integration  into  dynamic  decision-making  processes.  It  also  relies  on  the  provision  of  connected agents capable of performing tasks in real time and optimizing  their management. Concretely, it is about anticipating failures, shutdowns,  accidents in production processes or service systems and planning at best  replacement, renewal, return to service operations, etc.     The objective of this course is to give future decision-makers the necessary  culture to design, model and recommend predictive maintenance strategies.  Emphasis is placed on data-driven approaches and probabilistic or statistical  models  that  apply  to  any industrial  system. This  background  should  allow  effective interaction with engineers "business" very close to applications and  "data scientist" in charge of data processing        Quarter number  SG8     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  Basic knowledge in probability and statistics, data analytics, modeling and  optimisation     Syllabus   •  Course introduction; Project introduction;   •  Basics of data analytics (I): Feature extraction and data visualization  •  Fault detection and diagnosis (I): Unsupervised learning  •  Fault detection and diagnosis (II): Bayesian network   200      •  Fault detection and diagnosis (III): Causal inference (or neural   network)   •  Fault detection and diagnosis (IV): Semi-supervised learning  •  Renewal process theory and correntive maintenance planning  •  Scheduled maintenance  •  Predictive maintenance based on discrete state models (I)  •  Predictive maintenance based on discrete state models (II)  •  Predictive maintenance based on continuous state models  •  Project Defense      Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)   •  15h of lectures and 15h of tutorials with practical implementations   of the models.   •  Possibility to have a proportion of the lecture in inverse class.
