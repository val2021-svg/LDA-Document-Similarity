   2EL2520 - Electronics for biomedical and   communication applications       Instructors: Emilie Avignon-Meseldzija  Department: DÉPARTEMENT ÉLECTRONIQUE ET ÉLECTROMAGNÉTISME  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Engineering Sciences  Advanced level : Yes      Description  Analog  electronic  systems  are  presents  in  everyday  life  devices  (Smart  Phone,  biomedical  devices,  RFID  sensors…),  but  also  in  more  specific  and  advanced  applications  (devices  for  spatial  environment,  radar/telemetry,  aeronautical  devices...).  The  purpose  of  this  course  is  to  provide  design  methodologies for analog systems based on specification and the basics to  be able to analyze an existing circuit.   The proposed approach is based on the study of practical cases. After several  theoretical lecture, the student develops his skills through useful everyday  life  application  example  like  the  ElectroCardioGramm,  radio  transceiver,  pulse-oximeter.  Every  example  seen  allows  to  initiate  the  student  to  a  particular concept in electronics.     For students already passionate by electronics, it is possible to replace the  practical works by a personal project. It is mandatory for these students to  contact the responsible of the module at the very beginning of the course to  check the available material (components, devices, specific software…).    The  contexts  highlighted  in  this  course  are  radio  communication  and  biomedical  with  for  example  the  design  of  an  ECG  (ElectroCardioGram)  circuit.     Quarter number  SG8     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  The first objective of this course is to introduce and sensitize the students  to electronics through step-by-step real application cases. There is no need  of a high theoretical level in electronics to follow this course. Nevertheless,  it is recommended to master the very basics of electronic circuits to attend   216      this course (Kirchhoff voltage and current laws, Ohms law).     Syllabus  CM = Lecture  PC = Tutorial  Cours PC = between lecture and tutorial      CM1 : initiation to integrated circuits  Introduction to CMOS integrated techologies, cross sectional view of the  transistor, rough explanation of the transistor physics  CM2 : Model of integrated components  Model of passive compoents. Model of the MOS transistor in the different  functioning mode.  CM3 : Fundamental circuits for amplification  Analysis of fundamental circuits based on MOS transistors (common  source, common drain, common gate).   Cours PC1 : Study of circuits containing one or two transistors   PC1 : First study of a circuit containing one or two transistors  CM4 : Association of fundamental circuits  Design of fundamental blocks: bias current source, current mirror, voltage  reference….  Cours PC2 : Study of circuits composed of...circuits  PC2 : Study of a transonductance amplifier (OTA)  CM5 : Gm-C Filter synthesis  Cours PC3 & cours PC4 : Design of a Gm-C filter with LtSpice  CM6 : Transistor as a switch. Electronic circuits based on transistors used as  a switch.    The rest of the course is based on a mix of tutorial, small theoretical  presentation and practical work.    PC3 : TP1-2 preparation  TP 1-2 : Design of ECG circuit  PC4 : TP 3-4 preparation  TP 3-4  PC4 : TP 5-6 preparation  TP 5-6       Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)   The course mixes theoretical approach with tutorials presenting classical  practical cases commented by a teacher. This way the students get familiar   217      with the reasoning methodology and will be able to reproduce these  reasoning on other cases.       Grading  Quiz + homework + TP evaluation (powerpoint). The presence in practical  work is mandatory as the work done during the session (calculation,  solution search…) is part of the evalutation. The presence is also  mandatory for personal project.     Course support, bibliography  Tony Cahn Carusone, David A. Johns, Kenneth W. Martin “Analog  Integrated Circuit Design” Wiley    R.

This is  why this course mixes theoretical approach with tutorials presenting  classical practical cases commented by a teacher. Most of the practical  cases are illustrated by a LtSpice circuits available to the students, so they  can be simulated simultaneously during the courses and increase the  understanding of the phenomena.     Learning outcomes covered on the course   After this course, the students will be capable of:   - designing an electronic assembly to achieve an analog signal processing  chain for biomedical or communication application  - analyzing an electronic assembly based on opamp, transistors and passive  elements       Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course   C1.4 Specify, design, build and validate all or part of a complex system  C6.2 Practice collaborative design through design or prototyping tools  (CAD, 3D printers...)  C8.1 Work in team/collaboration  C2.1 Have developed a field or discipline related to the basic engineering  sciences   218
