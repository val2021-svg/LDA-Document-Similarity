   2EL2240 - Mobility issues       Instructors: Yannick PEREZ  Department: DÉPARTEMENT GÉNIE INDUSTRIEL ET OPÉRATIONS  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Fundamental Sciences  Advanced level : No        Description     The  course  will  examine  three  innovations  that  are  set  to  profoundly  transform the industry associated with personal mobility.The first two are  primarily technological in nature, they are the autonomous vehicle and the  electric vehicle - battery or hydrogen. The third is related to the penetration  and generalization of new information and communication technologies and  the IoT in mobility which allows the implementation of the principles of the  sharing economy.  The motivation for studying the combination of these three innovations is to  determine the conditions for moving from a model of individual ownership  of  mobility  goods  with  considerable  negative  externalities  in  terms  of  pollution,  congestion,  accidentology  to  uses  of  services.  of  autonomous,  electric  and  /  or  shared  mobility  which  could  provide  solutions  to  the  aforementioned problems.  This transformation of the means of mobility is therefore at the crossroads  of engineering approaches (how to set up autonomous mobility, what uses  of 5G for mobility, how to use artificial intelligence, how to include electric  vehicles  in  electricity  networks  for  smart  recharging  based  on  renewable  energy, etc.), the industrial economist (what underlying economic models,  what regulation of uses, what games of players in an industry undergoing  profound  reorganization)  and  analyzes  of  mobility  needs  and  consumer  behavior (what incentives for adopting behavior, acceptance of car-sharing,  new behavior and micro-mobility, multimodal transfers, etc.).       Quarter number  SG8     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  nothing    203        Syllabus    Course 1: Introduction to energy transition and mobility.  Course 2: Electric Vehicle for Everything: Income Flow Framework  Course 3: Design pricing for EVs and renewable energy.  Course 4: Theories and applications of infrastructure deployments.  Course 5: Car Sharing Economics  Course 6: Car Sharing Economics an application in the Paris region   Course 7: Autonomous and shared electric vehicles: definitions, cost of  technologies, shared mobility  Course 8: Exploring the system impact of automated taxis via simulation  Course 9: New technologies for urban and last-mile deliveries  Course 10: Mobility as a service  Course 11: New perspectives on urban mobility       Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)  During the 3 hour session, the first hour and a half will be led by a speaker  (professor, researcher, town planner, economist, etc.) specializing in the  topic. The tutorials will be held during the following hour and a half. In the  tutorials, the students, in groups of 3, will make presentations on research  articles made available to them by the speakers.     Grading   The course will be evaluated on the group work carried out during the  tutorials for 60% of the final grade.  The 2-hour final exam will consist of 10 questions, one per course, for 40 %  of the final grade       Course support, bibliography  Main Reference     Sperling, Daniel (2018) Three Revolutions: Steering Automated, Shared,  and Electric Vehicles to a Better Future.
