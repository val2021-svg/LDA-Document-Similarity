   2SL1100 - Climate science and climate change issues       Instructors: Didier Paillard  Department: DÉPARTEMENT MÉCANIQUE ENERGÉTIQUE PROCÉDÉS  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS, ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY, CAMPUS DE METZ, CAMPUS DE RENNES  Workload (HEE): 20  On-site hours (HPE): 12,00          Description  The  objective  of  the  "Climate  Sciences"  course  is  to  provide  the  scientific  basis for understanding the issues and challenges of current climate change.  A first step is to situate the current transition in the more general context of  climate changes that already occured in the past. Indeed, it is only through  the evocation of these past crises that we can draw a picture of the various  consequences  of  the  current  crisis  (climate,  sea  level,  acidification,  ecosystem  changes,  etc.).  In  addition,  it  is  necessary  to  present  the  main  physical  principles  which  determine  climate,  in  particular  the  planet's  radiation balance and its geographical and seasonal variations, but also the  basic  ingredients  of  the  greenhouse  effect,  in  particular  the  carbon  cycle  which modifies and regulates climate on various time scales.  Beyond these general points, the objective of the course is also to present  the  modeling  tools  that  are  used  today,  both  to  better  understand  and  quantify  the  processes  involved,  but  also  to  simulate  possible  future  climates.  For  this,  it  is  important  to  specify  what  is  the  physical  and  geochemical content of these models by detailing the respective role of the  conservation  equations  and  that  of  the  parametrizations.  In  the  end,  as  there  is  no  perfect  tool  integrating  all  the  processes,  it  is  necessary  to  establish  various  modeling  strategies  to  answer  different  scientific  or  societal questions.       Quarter number  ST5     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  No prerequisites.     Syllabus    •  observation of natural climate variability and its phenomenology:   forcings, feedbacks, threshold effects, flip-flops, and hysteresis.   36      •  the main physical and chemical principles: the greenhouse effect  (radiation), energy and water transport (balance equations, heat  transfer, thermodynamics), the carbon cycle.   •  numerical simulations of the climate.  •  anthropogenic impact factors: greenhouse gas emissions, aerosols,   land use, and future scenarios.

Teaching Team (LSCE): Masa Kageyama, Didier Paillard.    Lectures in French   Tutorials in French or English.       Learning outcomes covered on the course   At the end of this teaching, the student will be able to :   •  anchor the questions relating to climate change currently under   way in the familiar physical principles of engineering  (thermodynamics; mass, energy and momentum balance,...).   •  understand the orders of magnitude for energy, the natural carbon   cycle and their anthropogenic disturbances.   •  implement the notions of feedback, threshold, hysteresis, complex   system, in the context of the functioning of planet Earth.   37           Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course     C1.1 Examine a problem in full breadth and depth, within and beyond its  immediate parameters, thus understanding it as a whole. This whole  weaves the scientific, economic and social dimensions of the problem.  C2.1 Thoroughly master a domain or discipline based on the fundamental  sciences or the engineering sciences.   C2.2 Import knowledge from other scientific fields or disciplines  C9.4 Demonstrate rigour and critical thinking in approaching problems  from all angles, scientific, human and economic.   38
