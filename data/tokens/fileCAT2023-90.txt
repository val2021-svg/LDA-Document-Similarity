   2EL6020 - Computer Architecture       Instructors: Ruben Salvador Perea  Department: CAMPUS DE RENNES  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE RENNES  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Fundamental Sciences  Advanced level : Yes      Description  This  elective  course  is  open  to  any  interested  student  while  it  is  also  mandatory for the InfoSec track.     Microprocessors are omnipresent in today's society. However, their design,  implementation  and  construction  remain  a  challenge  that  have  a  major  impact  on  the  performance  and  overall  security  of  computing  systems.    The  main  objective  of  this  course  is  to  give  students  all  necessary  basic  knowledge to understand how modern processors work. We will lay out the  fundamental  concepts  and  techniques  in  computer  architecture,  with  a  focus  on  the  hardware/software  interface  and  a  bottom-up  approach  to  understand how computers work and how they can actually be designed.    This course is largely inspired by Patterson and Hennessy's book "Computer  Organization and Design, The Hardware/Software interface, RISC-V Edition,  Morgan  Kaufmann,  2018",  and  it  will  be  used  as  the  main  book  for  the  course. Both did pioneering work on computer architecture, specifically in  "Reduced  Instruction  Set  Computer"  (RISC) architectures.  David  Patterson  coined the term RISC, while John L. Hennessy was the inventor of the MIPS  microprocessor.  Both  won  the  2017  Turing  Award  for  their  work  in  RISC  architectures.     Quarter number  SG6     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)   This course builds on fundamental concepts from:  - 1CC1000 - Information systems and programming  - 1EL8000 - Electronic Systems (particularly important is the "digital  electronics" part)  Certain notions on algorithms & complexity fundamentals are also  interesting.   288           Syllabus     Digital circuit design using a Hardware Description Language (HDL)  (4.5h lectures + 6h tutorials)    •  Combinational logic circuits design  •  Sequential logic circuits design, Finite State Machines (FSM), análisis   temporal   •  Reconfigurable circuits: the Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)  •  HDL design flow for FPGAs (HDL description, simulation, synthesis)   Computer architecture and RISC-V (10.5h lectures + 12h labs)    •  The Von Neumann model of computer architectures   •  RISC/CISC architecture paradigms  •  RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA), addressing modes  •  Processor components: datapath, register file, arithmetic logic unit   (ALU), control unit, memory, peripherals   •  Interrupts and exceptions  •  Performance: pipeline, memory hierarchy and caches, branch   prediction, out-of-order execution   •  Notions on processor architecture security   Tutorials and Labs    •  VHDL design flow for FPGAs  •  RISC-V assembly programming  •  VHDL design of (a subpart of) a RISC-V processor      Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)   Lectures : 15h  Tutorials : 6h  Labs : 12h     Grading   Final exam (written or oral): 40%  Lab exam (project technical realization, demonstration and oral defense):  40%  Course assignments (exercises, readings ...): 20%       Course support, bibliography    •  Slides provided to students   289      •  Main books for the course: The are some copies of these books at   the library and they are also available from the school ebook  platform at: https://www-vlebooks-com.ezproxy.universite-parissaclay.fr/    o  D.
