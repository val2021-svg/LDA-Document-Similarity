   2EL2420 - Digital image processing       Instructors: Elisabeth LAHALLE, Charles Soussen  Department: DÉPARTEMENT SIGNAL, INFORMATION, COMMUNICATION  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Fundamental Sciences  Advanced level : Yes      Description    In  many  fields  such  as  health,  video  surveillance,  microscopy  or  remote  sensing,  simple  or  sophisticated  image  acquisition  systems  have  been  designed to produce digital images of all kinds: 2D images, 3D images, color  images,  videos,  hyperspectral  includes  the  reconstruction of images from indirect measurements (e.g. in MRI and CT  scan  imaging),  the  reconstruction  of  3D  scenes  in  computer  vision,  image  segmentation,  image  registration,  and  hyperspectral  image  analysis  in  remote sensing.   Image  analysis   images.   The  objective  of  the  course  is  twofold.  On  the  one  hand,  fundamental  concepts  of  image  processing  will  be  taught,  ranging  from  elementary  analyses to process grayscale and color images (thresholding, histograming,  coding) to linear and non-linear filtering operations, carried out in the spatial  domain and in the Fourier domain. On the other hand, advanced processing  will  be  addressed  to  overcome  the  limits  of  conventional  filtering  approaches.  They  include  image  segmentation using  geometric  models to  describe  regions  and  contours,  and  the  so-called  variational  approach,  where  image  reconstruction  is  formulated  as  the  optimization  of  a  largescale  criterion.  The  variational  approach  is  developed  extensively  and  illustrated in the case of image denoising and image deconvolution.
