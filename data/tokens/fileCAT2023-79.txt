   2EL5060 - Analysis and processing of audio data (speech   and music)       Instructors: Stephane Rossignol  Department: CAMPUS DE METZ  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE METZ  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Fundamental Sciences  Advanced level : Yes      Description  The  aim  of  this  course  is  to  present  the  corpus  of  non-parametric  and  parametric spectral analysis methods, as part of the analysis of musical and  speech sound signals.    Spectral  analysis  is  one  of  the  elements  of  signal  processing  chains;  therefore, it is not just the visualization of spectra. The main objective is to  decide and/or estimate. Some examples: What was the original score? Or  what  instruments  are  present  in  the  orchestra?  What  is  the  fundamental  frequency of this or that sound? What does this person say? Where is this  person  or  this  other  one?  Etc.  The  choice  of  this  or  that  spectral  analysis  method is crucial, depending on the current problem.    The focus is put on the different concepts underlying each method, and the  performance  of  these  methods  are  compared.  This  last  approach  also  highlights the concept of modeling (physical modeling/signal modeling/...),  inherent in an efficient engineering approach.    Moreover, the various tools are studied in the context of the observation of  the  human  being,  who  communicates  with  his  fellow  beings  and  his  environment  through  his  senses.  Of  these,  sight  and  hearing  are  the  best  known,  and  only  they  allow  a  remote  approach  to  the  environment.  Communication  (human-to-human,  human-to-machine  or  machine-to-human)  are  designed  to  acquire  and  reproduce  these  perceptions as faithfully as possible. It is therefore useful to know and be  able to model in detail on the one hand the system of human perception,  that is to say the receiver (the ear, here), but also the system of production  of  the  signal  concerned by the  perception  (human  speech,  music,  various  sounds), that is, the transmitter.   systems   259        The  sound  platforms  of  the  Metz  campus  (holophony  room  and  anechoic  room) are used for the practical aspects of this course.    This course has many areas of application: in-depth analyzes of time series;  sound analysis for recognition and coding; phonetic coders for telephony;  tools for the arts.
