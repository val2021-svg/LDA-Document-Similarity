   2EL5020 - Introduction to multi-tier application   development and web services       Instructors: Michel Ianotto  Department: CAMPUS DE METZ  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE METZ  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Fundamental Sciences  Advanced level : Yes      Description  More  and  more  applications  are  built  as  a  composition  of  services.  The  objective  of  this  course  is  to  present  the  underlying  architectures  and  to  introduce students to the development of solutions exploiting, creating and  deploying  services.    Enterprise applications access local or remote data, apply business logic to  them,  and  then  present  or  transmit  the  results.  To  ease  their  design,  implementation  and  operation,  they  can  be  decomposed  into  layers  and  components. The Java Enterprise Edition (JEE) platform is designed to enable  the  development  of  these  applications  and  their  integration  into  existing  information  systems.  The  course  will  present  the  principles  of  the  3-tier  architecture,  with  an  implementation  exploiting  the  main  components  of  the  JEE  platform.  The  application  will  then  be  deployed  in  the  cloud.    The application may require access to online data. Web pages are important  data sources but they are designed for human interaction. A tedious process  ("web scraping") needs be set up on a case-by-case basis so that a machine  (a program) can recover the data exposed by web pages. Fortunately, many  players  such  as  Amazon  or  eBay  for  example  offer  another  interface  to  access  data,  focused  on  resources  or  processes  and  not  on  graphical  presentation. These "web services" simplify the data collection phase and  allow  their  consumers  to  focus  on  their  core  business.  This  course  will  present how to discover a service, how to invoke it, and possibly how to build  a  composition  of  several  services.  It  may  also  be  relevant  to  open  the  developed application to partners (customers, suppliers ...). The course will  present how to offer them such a service: how to design a service, develop  and deploy it, describe it and make it discoverable.        245      Quarter  SG8     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)    1CC1000 - Information Systems and Programming   number        Syllabus  Java programming basics    Introduction   •  N-tier architectures  •  Application servers  •  The MVC model   Data persistence in Java    •  DBMS  •  The JPA specification  •  Object-relational mapping (ORM)   Business layer implementation    •  Enterprise Java Beans containers(EJB)  •  Presentation layer implementation  •  JSPs and Servlets   Presentation of treatment-oriented services    •  Architectural principles  •  Introduction to XML  •  SOAP protocol overview  •  WSDL description language  •  Practice: definition of a service contract, development of a server,   publication of the interface to the client as a development kit   Presentation of resource-oriented services    •  REST architectural style  •  Introduction to JSON and OpenAPI  •  Practice: development of a client application requesting online   services, development, test and deployment of a service    246           Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)    The approximate distribution of "student presence hours" will be as  follows: 24h of lectures and 9h of tutorial sessions in the computer room.   The structure "16 lectures + 6 labs" is administrative because the course is  actually mostly composed of "learning by doing" sessions led by teachers.       Grading    Students’ knowledge and skills will be evaluated regularly by short  individual written tests during lessons and on the basis of a small project  carried out in pairs and presented at the end of the course. Score weights:  individual tests : 50%, project completion: 30%, presentation of the  project: 20%. The catch-up exam will be in the form of oral exam with  exercices partly done on computer. In case of a justified absence to one of  the intermediary examinations, the grade of this latter is replaced by the  grade of the final examination.
