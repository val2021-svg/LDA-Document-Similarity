   2EL1830 - Non-linear behavior of materials       Instructors: Véronique Aubin  Department: DÉPARTEMENT MÉCANIQUE ENERGÉTIQUE PROCÉDÉS  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Engineering Sciences  Advanced level : Yes      Description  The design of material structures and their optimization (in terms of service  life, performance, cost) requires the ability to predict the response of the  materials considered for this application under the stresses imposed during  their service life (load, temperature, stress, humidity, etc.).    The  objective  of  this  course  is  to  highlight  the  mechanical  behaviour  and  durability of the main classes of materials under various loading conditions,  to understand the physical basis of the micro-mechanisms involved, and to  use  relevant  modelling  for  design,  as  part  of  numerical  methods.  The  concepts are introduced as part of the mechanics of continuous media, and  use concepts related to the Materials course.    Applications in transport, energy, electronic systems and civil engineering.

Polymer and elastomer viscoelasticity: Introduction to polymers  (nature, behavior with respect to temperature). Viscoelasticity. Time  dependent behavior.   5.    Mechanisms of plasticity in metallic alloys: Structure and defects of  crystalline materials. Dislocations and Schmid factor. Hardening of alloys.  6.

Safety of structures - damage and fracture: introduction to concrete  (nature and specificities in behavior and damage). Volume damage. Crack  sustainability.  10.    Case study (use of the various concepts of the course on a given  application)  11.    Case study(use of the various concepts of the course on a given  application)  12.    Final examination       Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)   -    Sessions 1 to 6: lecture + directed study session  -    Session 7: working session  -    Sessions 8 and 9: lecture + directed study session  -    Sessions 10 and 11: working session  -    Session 12: final exam 2H     Grading   The final examination consists in one exam (70% of the grade) and a report  on a case study (30% of the grade).   The final case study allows to evaluate learning outcomes #1, 4 and 5,  whereas the exam gives the opportunity to evaluate learning outcomes #1,  2, 3 and 4. Every learning outcome is evaluated separately. A feed-back is  given to the students on the skills they have developed.  As examination and case study report assess different skills, both will be  required for remedial where applicable.        Course support, bibliography  No handout, but a list of books.

Have a critical analysis of the simulation results  obtained.          •   Persuade at the level of core values; to be clear about objectives   and expected results. To apply rigour when it comes to assumptions  and structured undertakings, and in doing so structure and  problematise the ideas themselves. To make the added value  known.      Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course   The first learning outcome allows to reach milestone 1 of skill C1.1. (  Examine problems in their entirety and beyond their immediate  parameters. Identify, formulate and analyse the scientific, economic and  human dimensions of a problem)  Learning outcomes #2 and 3 allow to reach milestones 2 or 3 of skill C1.2.  (Develop and use appropriate models, choosing the correct modelling scale  and simplifying assumptions when addressing a problem )  Learning outcome #4 allows to reach milestone 2B of skill C1.3 (Solve  problems using approximation, simulation and experimentation)  Learning outcome #5 allows to reach milestone 1 of skill C7.1 (Persuade at  core value level; to be clear about objectives and expected results. To apply  rigour when it comes to assumptions and structured undertakings, and in  doing so structure and problematise the ideas themselves. Highlight the  added value)  In conclusion, the course allows for progress in the C1 and C7 skills   146
