   2EL6130 - Embedded systems and internet of things       Instructors: Guillaume Hiet  Department: CAMPUS DE RENNES  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE RENNES  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Engineering Sciences  Advanced level : Yes      Description   This  elective  course  is  part  of  the  Infosec  track,  but  can  be  taken  by  any  second year student that knows how to program in C and Java. The goal of  this  elective  course  is  to  discover  the  specificities  of  the  development  of  applications that are executed on embeded systems or IoT objects.     The constraints for developing these connected objects are multiple: energy  limits,  computing  capacities,  network  connectivy,  data  overloading,  real  time, etc. Indeed, this elective course will focus on general principle that are  shared  by  these  devices,  ofr  example,  the  data  upload  to  the  cloud,  the  optimization  of  the  software  computing,  the  network  connectivity.     In a second part, the elective course illustrates these principles by selecting  real embedded systems on which we study the software ecosystem. From  the  language  point  of  view,  the  course  shows  how  can  be  used  the  C  language or languages using virtual machines and in both cases, how these  languages are used in embedded systems. For the data, the course presents  the solutions for storing locally or using programming API which enables to  upload  infrastructures.     This  course  may  be  enriched  by  industrial  partners  that  can  provide  their  expertise for specific embedded devices.
