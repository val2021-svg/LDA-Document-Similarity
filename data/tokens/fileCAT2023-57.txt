   2EL2170 - Economics of growth and innovation       Instructors: Mehdi SENOUCI  Department: DÉPARTEMENT SCIENCES HUMAINES ET SOCIALES  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Business Sciences  Advanced level : Yes      Description   Economic growth, in a broad sense, is a concept that refers to all economic  changes over time. One of the strongest consensuses in economics is that  which links growth to innovation. The first objective of the course is to make  students aware of the study of economic growth, both long and short term,  by trying to convince them that the regularities as well as the paradoxes of  growth  justify  an  analytical  approach  combining  the  exploration  of  facts,  empirical analyses and theory-building. The second objective is to present  the great economic evolutions of the world from the origins to the present  day, with greater importance given to the modern era, as well as the theories  related to each era and each transition. The third and more diffuse objective  is  to  push  students  to  question  the  future  consequences  of  innovations  currently underway or in the making. The course will combine theory and  empirical studies following the red thread of history.    The course, demanding and research-oriented, is reserved for an audience  willing  to  get  involved.  Apart  from  the  final  exam,  two  reports  will  be  required  (one  in  tutorials)  which  will  be  based  on  the  critical  reading  of  research papers.
