   2EL5050 - Estimation methods and introduction to the   modern coding theory       Instructors: Michel Barret  Department: CAMPUS DE METZ  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE METZ  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Fundamental Sciences  Advanced level : Yes      Description  This course presents two key issues of decision theory: pure estimation and  detection.  More  precisely,  the  following  notions  will  be  presented  and  implemented  numerically:  formalization  of  estimation  and  detection  problems, influence of cost function, Bayesian / non-Bayesian point of view,  prior information. The problems of estimating power spectral density and  prediction, with finite and infinite past, of a second-order ergodic time series  will be studied in detail. Finally, the four fundamental coding theorems for  discrete memoryless systems will be presented with their proofs.

Starting from such a problem, they will be able:    •      to model it by introducing a suitable cost function;  •      to propose an adequate solution (adapted to the information a   priori)   •      to prove the optimality of the solution under certain conditions   that they will be able to explain;   •      to implement the method on data;  •      to criticize the results.     In addition, at the end of the course, students should have acquired basic  knowledge of the modern theory of coding for discrete memoryless  systems (channel, source with side information to the decoder), where the  above estimation and detection methods are applied.       Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course   Skills developed by the course   •  C1: Analyze, design and build complex systems with scientific,   technological, human and economic components   •  C2: Develop an in-depth skills in an engineering field and in a family   of professions   258
