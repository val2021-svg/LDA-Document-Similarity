   2EL5090 - Design of complex electronic systems: from   component to heterogeneous system       Instructors: Yves Houzelle  Department: CAMPUS DE METZ  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE METZ  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Engineering Sciences  Advanced level : Yes      Description  For a decade, French electronics has invested in high value‐added areas and  advanced  sectors  such  as  aeronautics,  defense,  medical,  smart  card  payment, fiber optic telecommunications ..., discarding consumer products  such as televisions and telephones.  Electronic systems cover a wide range of applications, ranging from analog  electronics,  with  the  amplifier  as  a  basic  function,  to  digital  electronics,  which implements the "smart" part of systems. In addition, the frequency  range  extends  over  a  very  broad  spectrum  ranging  from  low  frequency  applications  such  as  audio  processing  to  very  high  frequency  applications  such as radio communications.   The very different constraints related to this wide variety of themes impose  different design tools that are adapted to each problem.  This course will provide students with basic concepts and knowledge of the  tools used to design both analog and digital electronic systems.       Quarter number  SG6     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  Automatic course of ST5. Having followed the 1st year elective course of  Electronic Systems (1EL8000) can be a plus.     Syllabus   The course will present the components and methods of synthesis using  the different tools (and understanding their limits) in order to give the  future engineers the means to take part in the design of heterogeneous  electronic systems.     268           Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)   Teaching will be given in the form of directed courses with presentations of  concepts, application exercises and practical work.         Grading  A written report will be requested on Laboratory Work. The final written  exam will count for 70% of the final grade. The Laboratory Work report will  count for 30% of the final grade.The catch-up session will be in the form of  an oral examination.  An unjustified absence in Laboratory Work will be penalized with a 0 for  the session.
