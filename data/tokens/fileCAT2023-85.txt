2EL5130 - Chaos, Fractals and complexity          Instructors: Damien Rontani  Department: CAMPUS DE METZ  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE METZ  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Fundamental Sciences  Advanced level : Yes      Description    Neural networks, electronic or optical oscillators, or even chemical reaction  are  various  examples  of  dynamical  systems,  where  the  state  variable  describing  their  spatiotemporal  evolution  evolve  in  a  nonlinear  fashion.  From  the  intrinsic  nonlinearity  present  in  these  systems  stems  rich  dynamical behaviors, which allows for the observation of novel phenomena  of  interest  for  scientists  and  engineers.  We  can  cite  chaotic  dynamics  for  example, explaining the impossibility to provide accurate long-term weather  forecasting or collective phenomena, such as synchronisation, with multiple  applications in neurosciences.   This  lecture  will  provide  to  the  student  with  the  fundamental  tools  and  framework of science of complexity. It will be illustrated by multiple example  from recent research articles with application in the field of engineering. The  student will use analytical and numerical techniques form the resolution of  problems.
