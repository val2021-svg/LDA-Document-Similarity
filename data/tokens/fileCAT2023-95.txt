2EL6090 - Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning          Instructors: Catherine Soladie  Department: CAMPUS DE RENNES  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE RENNES  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Fundamental Sciences  Advanced level : Yes      Description     DNA or line of code?      Homo Sapiens is cut to walk on two feet, yet he must learn a year before  getting  up.  Underwater  creatures  can  move  in  total  darkness,  and  their  species have evolved over millions of years to achieve this result. Adaptation  to a milieu, to a problem, or intelligence, are not static notions but the result  of a constant effort: learning.  Thus,  the  emergence  of  technological  systems  capable  of  prediction,  of  expertise,  quickly  raises  the  question  of  learning.  How  can  a  program  acquire,  assimilate,  organize  knowledge?  On  this  point,  taking  inspiration  from the living is a rather fruitful starting point. How to mimic the behavior  of  our  neurons?  That  of  evolution  and  natural  selection?  What  results  to  expect?  In  this  elective,  you  will  discover  the  principal  methods  of  Artificial  Intelligence and how they work. You will be able to take in hand the most  recent  algorithm on  concrete  cases,  and  you will  have the  opportunity to  push the study on a subject of your choice. It's up to you to learn how to  learn!
