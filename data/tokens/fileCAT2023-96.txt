   2EL6100 - Communication Systems Engineering       Instructors: Haïfa Jridi  Department: CAMPUS DE RENNES  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE RENNES  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Fundamental Sciences  Advanced level : Yes      Description   All  communications  today  (mobile  communication,  satellites,  local  area  networks, ADSL wired networks, etc.) offer higher bit rates thanks to digital  processing  whose  fundamentals  have  been  stated  from  the  information  theory of Claude Shannon (1948) based on the the two following principles:   •  Source Coding trying to remove unnecessary redundancies in the   transmitted messages and to gain in information rates.    •  Channel coding to protect the transmission of the compressed   information toward the receiver aiming to minimize errors for the  detected signal.   For ideal transmission over a Gaussian channel, joint source / channel coding  is  the  appropiate  way  to  approach  the  theoretical  limit  of  the  maximum  achievable date rate predicted by information theory.     On the other hand, for a wide spectrum of applications, the channel can be  much  more  restrictive  with  phenomena  such  as  selectivity,  multi-path  transmission, the Doppler effect ... However, even for this type of channel,  there  are,  fortunately,  other  ways  of  protecting  the  information  (besides  channel  coding)  mainly  using  the  notion  of  diversity  (temporal,  spectral,  spatial ...)       Quarter number  SG6     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)   - Notions of probabilities  - Digital Signal Processing (Fourier Transform, Spectral Analysis)    These knowledges are learned from signal processing (1CC4000) and  modelisation (1CC3000) courses.      310      Syllabus      Part 1 : Information theory   •  What is information? Mutual information? Entropy?  •  Channel capacity  •  Shannon ‘s theorems (channel and source coding)   Part 2 : Source coding   •  Codes with fixed and variable lengths  •  Huffman codes  •  Applications (JPEG, MPEG, MP3, H264)   Part 3 : Redundancy for information protection (Channel coding,  Diversity and retransmission protocols)   •  Block codes   •  Convolutional codes  •  Viterbi decoding  •  Applications: video broadcasting, mobiles communications, etc.   •  To go further: LDPC codes, turbo codes, polar codes, ….  •  Diversity concept (temporal, spectral, spatial, cooperation)  •  Retransmission protocols (ARQ, HARQ, IR)     Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)  The fundamentals are presented in lectures with specific examples.  Exercices ensure a good understanding of the course and correct the  misinterpretations of the course. Personal works are additional courses  requested from students (applications and extensions).       Grading  Final exam : coefficient 0,5 Laboratory exam : coefficient 0,25 Personnal  work : coefficient 0,25 In case of a justified absence to one of the  intermediary examinations, the grade of this latter is replaced by the grade  of the final examination.The grade of the laboratiry exam is based primarily  on the level of involvement provided during the sessions and secondarily  on the mandatory report.

The second  objective is to detail what a digital transmission is and what are the  different requirements to target expected performance.    For instance, the students will be able to:    •  understand a digital communication chain  •  understand the different chain blocks  •  understand the metrics of performance evaluation of a digital   transmission   •  optimize the dimensioning of a transmission chain under   constraints (performance trade-offs)   •  generate, analyze, process digital signals with Matlab              312         Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course   In terms of skills:   •  The first three course outcomes aim to acquire the C1.2 skill  "Develop and use appropriate models, choosing the correct  modelling scale and simplifying assumptions when addressing a  problem"   •  The outcomes 4 and 5 contribute to the core of C1.3 skill "Apply   problem-solving through approximation, simulation and  experimentation. / Solve problems using approximation, simulation  and experimentation"   •  The outcome 5 adresses the C1.4 skill "Design, detail and   corroborate a whole or part of a complex system"   •  Tutorials and personal work contribute to develop both C8.1 skill  "Work collaboratively in a team" and C3.1 skill "Be proactive and  involved, take initiatives"   •  The personal work, for instance, helps to deepen the C7.1 skill  "Persuade at core value level; to be clear about objectives and  expected results. To apply rigour when it comes to assumptions and  structured undertakings, and in doing so structure and  problematise the ideas themselves. Highlight the added value"   313
