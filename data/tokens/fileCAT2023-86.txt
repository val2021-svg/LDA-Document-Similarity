2EL5140 - Modeling for Systems Engineering          Instructors: Virginie Galtier  Department: CAMPUS DE METZ  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE METZ  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Engineering Sciences  Advanced level : Yes      Description    Complex  systems  involve  many  heterogeneous  elements  (mechanical,  software, economic...). Systems engineering is an interdisciplinary approach  allowing  us  to  design,  verify,  and  develop  them  in  a  controlled  way.  According  to  INCOSE  (International  Council  on  Systems  Engineering),  research shows effective use of Systems Engineering can save 10-20% of the  project  budget.  It  is  not  hard  to  know  when  Systems  Engineering  fails,  because when something important goes wrong it usually makes the news  fast.  People  get  hurt,  programs  are  delayed  and  over  budget:  from  the  problems  encountered  by  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope,  to  the  crashes  of  Boeing’s  737  Max  airplane,  and  the  construction  of  the  Channel  Tunnel  which came 80% over-budget. But when Systems Engineering goes right, noone notices- which is just how it should be. This course focuses on modeling,  on which rely systems engineering methodologies and tools.   Quarter number  SG6     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)    Systems Modeling (ST5 course)     Syllabus    Introduction   definition(s) of a model  system lifecycle  objective and fundamentals of MBSE (Model-Based Systems  Engineering)  introduction to SysML   Requirements Modeling   stakeholder identification   280      use case definition  requirements diagram   Functional and Structural Modeling   basis for structural decomposition, notions of interfaces  block definition, activities and states diagrams  allocation and traceability  model animation    Decision Making    Additional topic    matrix-based structural complexity management  trade-off analysis    an industrial point of view, topic may vary (example in 2020:  the Modelica language, model exchange using the FMI  standard)       Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)  The structure "6 labs + 16 lectures" is administrative because the elective is  actually composed of sessions that include:    •  a presentation of general concepts that can be reused by students   in many contexts,   •  an MCQ to check that the students have understood the key points,  •  a guided practice exercise based on a common example,  •  an application to a project developed in small groups.    Grading    Individual continuous assessment (50%) and project final group  presentation (50%, which would be made personal in case the  contributions are too different from one student to the next)   Re-take exam: oral examination including a practical exercise on a  computer    Course support, bibliography    Guide to the SEBoK (https://www.sebokwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page)   INCOSE SE Vision 25 (https://www.incose.org/docs/defaultsource/aboutse/se-vision-2025.pdf?sfvrsn=b69eb4c6₄)   SysML Distilled, Lenny Delligatti, Addison-Wesley, 2014  (https://app.ute.edu.ec/content/4915-114-4-1-619/SysML%20Distilled_%20A%20Brief%20Guide%20%20Lenny%20Delligatti.pdf)   281         Resources    Teaching staff: Virginie Galtier, and a guest speaker   Software: students are asked to install Cameo Systems Modeler on their PC  according to the instructions and license provided in the first class;  occasional use of other open-source and free tools    Note: Written material is mostly in English.     Learning outcomes covered on the course     At the end of this course, students:   •  will be able to imagine a system modeling approach and will be   familiar with a methodology (Magic Grid),   •  will know the concepts of systems modeling,  •  will be able to deploy a system model based on the different SysML   •  will be familiar with an industrial modeling tool (Cameo Systems   •  will be able to exploit some behavioral modeling techniques of a   system in order to predict its behavior,   •  will be able to integrate specific domain models using the FMI   diagrams,   Modeler),   standard       Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course    •  C1: Analyze, design, and build complex systems with scientific,   technological, human, and economic components    •  C2: Develop in-depth skills in an engineering field and a family of   •  C4: Have a sense of value creation for his company and his   professions    customers    282
