   2SL5000 - "Engineering Skills" Workshops       Instructors: Philippe Moustard, Christophe Laux  Department: DÉPARTEMENT DÉVELOPPEMENT PROFESSIONNEL ET MÉTIERS DE  L'INGÉNIEUR  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE METZ, CAMPUS DE RENNES, CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 40  On-site hours (HPE): 21,00          Description  This  course  is  the  continuation  of  1SL5000.  The  objective  is  to  continue  exploring  and  developing  the  skills  expected  from  a  CentraleSupelec  engineer:  teamwork,  project  management,  communication,  complex  problem solving, creativity, leadership, ethics, multicultural awareness.     Quarter number  ST5, SG6, ST7 and SG8     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)   It is highly recommended to have taken the 1SL500 course.   Because the workshops are held in French and are highly interactive, a  good command of spoken French is recommended. Homework and reports  may be written in English.       Syllabus   Key skills of the engineer:  - teamwork: organize, decide, lead in a team; different roles of team  members; influence of the personality on the performance of the team  - oral communication: develop impactful oral communication, speak in  public, structure a synthesis, build a presentation  - approach to solving complex problems:analyze the issues, make robust  assumtions, use relevant orders of magnitude, manage risk and uncertainty  - creativity: understand group creativity methods  - leadership and self-knowledge  - multicultural: open to others, understand how to adjust to a different  environment  - ethics: act ethically, understand the consequences of one's choices    API 8: Ethics  API 9: 2-Tons workshop, then project review   46      API 10: Leadership  API 11: Multicultural awareness  API 12: Project Coaching  API 13: Project Coaching   API 14: Project Coaching       Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)  - Case studies in groups  - Practical applications  - High student participation  - Application of the skills seen in the workshops to a real project  - Homework       Grading  Attendance at the workshops is mandatory because any absence penalizes  the learning of the student and handicaps the group.   The participation of each student during the workshops is graded because  it is a necessary condition for learning skills.   Individual or team work requested during workshops or between  workshops is graded. The respect of the deadlines intervenes in the  evaluation.   The team work gives rise to a collective grade for the team (except in the  obvious case of withdrawal of the team).   The individual essays are given full credit if they are turned in on time and  show sufficient quality of the personal reflection, without judgment on the  opinions expressed when they are argumented.   Mini-quizzes may be given at the beginning of some of the workshop, on  the content of previous workshops,. The quizzes are then graded.     The grade of each semester will be based on:  - Productions in the group work   - Individual and team homework (TIA)   - Quality of individual participation   - Result of the mini-quizz if any  An unjustified absence (ABI) leads to a penalty of 2 points per half-day of  absence    At the end of each semester, validation of some steps of the relevant  competencies.
