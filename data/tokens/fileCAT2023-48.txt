   2EL1920 - Advanced Quantum and Statistical Physics       Instructors: Jean-Michel Gillet  Department: DÉPARTEMENT PHYSIQUE  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Fundamental Sciences  Advanced level : Yes      Description   This  course  is  both  the  continuity  of  the  first  year  course  and  its  complement.  It allows us to come back to certain aspects which, due to lack of time, have  been  covered  too  superficially  for  an  effective  use  and  to  improve  the  understanding of a selection of basic concepts. It will be an opportunity to  discuss the statistical physics of open systems (grand-canonical ensembles)  and quantum statistics (bosons and fermions). Links will be established with  the basis of Hamiltonian (and Lagrangian) mechanics. The course also aims  to offer an extension to the quantum physics of atoms and molecules. The  last sequence will give a brief introduction to quantum intrication.       Quarter number  SG6     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  Prerequisite is:   The first year course on Quantum and Statistical Physics       Syllabus   We will discuss a selection of topics among which (non-contractual):   -  Basics of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics  -  Complements on the quantum harmonic oscillator  -  Complements on kinetic moment  -  Statistical physics of open systems  -  Quantum statistics  -  -  bosons  -  Fine and hyperfine structure of the atom  -  Variational theorem  -  The N-electron atom   fermions   155      -  Structure and properties of the atomic nucleus  -  Aspects of Quantum Molecular Physics  -  Quantum intrication and Bell inequalities        Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)  Lectures, exercises, reading and computer project   8 lectures  2 seminars (3h chacun).  10 exercices/projects        Grading  The  evaluation  is  done  by  means  of  2  components:  -The  quality  of  the  interaction  and  engagement  (while  solving  the  exercises,  answering  oral  questions during tutorials, lectures, numerical simulation project) - A written  test  (1h30)  whose  questions  relate  potentially  to  the  entire  program  and  which  allows  in  particular  to  evaluate  the  knowledge,  the  mastery  of  the  methods set out above and the associated skills. The continuous assessment  and project will be 30 % of the final grade.  Competence C1, milestone 2 will be tested by means of the numerical  project and an associated question during the final exam.       Course support, bibliography  The textbook is “Application-Driven Quantum and Statistical Physics” (Vol.  1, 2 & 3, World Scientific). Additional references will be given.     Resources   Teaching staff (instructor(s) names): C. Paillard, G. Schehr, T. Antoni, M.  Ayouz, E. Klein, J-M Gillet  · Maximum enrollment (default 35 students): 100  · Software, number of licenses required: Python and GAMESS  · Equipment-specific classrooms (specify the department and room  capacity): small amphitheater for lectures, 3 rooms for tutorials       Learning outcomes covered on the course   At the end of the course, a student will be able to :   - justify the structure of the first rows of the periodic table aswell as the  bonding mechanisms.   - decide the need for a quantum approach to temperature-dependent  problems.   - differentiate a fermionic behavior from that adopted by bosons. He can  then justify different components involved in response functions, such as  specific heat, especially at low temperatures.    156      - propose a method of quantum modeling for some important properties  of an ideal molecular gas but will know ways to take into account certain  interactions.       Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course   The skills targeted are   C1.2 (milestone 1 or 2): Study a problem as a whole, the situation as a  whole. Identify, formulate and analyse a problem in its scientific, economic  and human dimensions  and C1.3 (milestone 1): Solve the problem with approximation, simulation  and experimentation  Competences are tested by means of the numerical project and an  associated question during the final exam   157
