   2EL2010 - Understanding, optimization and simulation   of biotechnological processes       Instructors: Filipa Lopes  Department: DÉPARTEMENT MÉCANIQUE ENERGÉTIQUE PROCÉDÉS  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Engineering Sciences  Advanced level : Yes        Description    Biotechnology is defined as "the application of science and technology to the  transformation  of  materials  by  biological  agents  and  enzymes  to  produce  goods and services". Its fields of application are very broad and include many  industrial  applications,  particularly  in  the  health,  food,  waste  treatment,  energy production, cosmetics or pharmaceuticals sectors. Biotechnological  processes  are  undergoing  very  strong  development  and  recruitment.  The overall  objective of course  is  to  introduce  the  modern  approaches to  bioprocess  engineering  necessary  to  understand,  improve,  optimize  and  design  friendly  bioprocesses.   In this context, the bioprocess and its different stages (from the choice of  the microorganism to the recovery of products of interest and including the  bioreactor)  will  be  addressed  by  a  multi-scale  (from  the  cell  to  the  bioreactor)  and  multidisciplinary  approach  at  the  interfaces,  guided  by  simulation and optimization tools. This course is located between transfer  sciences,  process  engineering,  physics  and  life  sciences.  The  concepts  covered in this course will be used for some other courses of the dominant  (Life  science,  health  and  Environment,  Energy,...)  as  well  as  in  support  of  some Project Poles (Biotechnology and Health, Energy,...).     Quarter number    SG6     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)    Transport Phenomena (1A)    innovative,  competitive  and  more  environmentally   158        Syllabus      Microbiology :  - The cell;   - Microbial metabolism and its regulation.    Principles of bioprocess engineering:  - The bioreactor;  - The implementation of a bioprocess;  - Studies of emblematic examples: methanisation, alcoholic  fermentation, microalgae, activated sludge, etc.  - Operating modes;   - Mass transfer within the bioreactor.    Multi-scale modeling of the bioprocess:  - Macroscopic modeling ;  - Metabolic modeling ;  - Ownership of mass balance models;   - Calibration and validation of models.    Processes for the separation and purification of molecules of interest:  overview of techniques used in biorefinery.      Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)     General principles will be discussed and illustrated with industrial examples  and applications during lectures and tutorials. The students will thus  implement the knowledge acquired on practical engineering cases. In  parallel, students will develop a project whose goal is to propose a  bioprocess scheme for a given industrial application. Students, organised in  groups, will apply their knowledge to a case study. They will choose a topic  from among different biotechnological objectives. They will have to  propose both processes, suitable microorganisms and implement a  bioprocess model.       Grading    Final control (written) (65%) and oral presentation of the project by the  team (35%).     Course support, bibliography    Presentations of the speakers and books (Madigan, M. (2007).

Learning outcomes covered on the course     By the end of this course, the student will be able to:    - Explain the basics of living organisms functioning.  - Identify the phenomena (chemical, physical and biological) that occur  within the bioreactor.  - Write the reaction network characterizing the main mass flows within the  bioreactor, and adapted to the objectives of the model.  - Identify the mathematical expressions of the reaction kinetics associated  with the reaction network.  - Study the main properties of dynamic bioreactor models (positivity of  variables, boundarity, equilibrium, local stability).  - Calibrate a bioreactor model from experimental data.  - Explain the principle of operation of different downstream processes  usually used in biotechnology, identify their applications and estimate their  advantages and disadvantages.  - Propose a bioprocess scheme for a given application.     Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course    C1 - Analyse, design and implement complex systems made up of scientific,  technological, social and economic dimensions   C2 - Acquire and develop broad skills in a scientific or academic field and  applied professional areas   160
