   2CC2000 - System modeling       Instructors: Marija JANKOVIC  Department: DÉPARTEMENT GÉNIE INDUSTRIEL ET OPÉRATIONS  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS, ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY, CAMPUS DE METZ, CAMPUS DE RENNES  Workload (HEE): 10  On-site hours (HPE): 6,00          Description  The aim of this class is to raise awareness of students for System modelling  theories, process and techniques; in particular in the case of complex  systems. Future development challenges need to be supported by the  capabilities of engineers to identify factors underpinning a system, to  represent them in a formal way to predict system’s future behaviour; as  well as to understand the use of results and sensitivity analysis in the  implementation phase. Through different case studies, the students will be  introduced to system modelling (the need for multidisciplinary approaches,  issues and challenges in system modelling, etc.)     Quarter number  ST5     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)  "Modelling" cours (ST2)     Syllabus  The two sessions will be organised as following:   1.    Invited introductory conference that will though a case study illustrate  the needs and challenges of system modelling  2.    Introduction to the key notions for system modelling (using a industrial  illustration or case study)     Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)  Case studies      Course support, bibliography  Recommended text books :   •    “A practical guide to SySML: the system modeling language”,  Friedenthal & Steiner  •    « Model-Based Systems Engineering with OPM and SysML »,   Dori, Dov,   25      (2016).  •    « Structural complexity management », Lindemann, Maurer and Braun,  (2009).   •    « The limits to growth », Donella Meadows, Dennis Meadows, Jorgen  Rangers, Wiliam Behrens III      Learning outcomes covered on the course  At the end of this class, students will raise awareness for :  •    Systems thinking and system approaches to solve engineering problems  •    Needs and advantages of multidisciplinary approaches for complex  system design  •    Key points for system modelling such as system perimeter definition,  system interfaces definition and management, etc.     Description of the skills acquired at the end of the course  C1.1 Examine problems in their entirety and beyond their immediate  parameters. Identify, formulate and analyse the scientific, economic and  human dimensions of a problem  C1.5 Bring together broad scientific and technical concepts in a core  structure contained within the framework of an interdisciplinary approach.  C9.2 Identify, within a given structure, the scope of liability as well as socioethical and environmental responsibilities.  26
