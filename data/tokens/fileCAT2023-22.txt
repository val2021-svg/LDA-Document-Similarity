   2EL1310 - Renewable energies       Instructors: Amir Arzandé  Department: DÉPARTEMENT SYSTÈMES D'ÉNERGIE ÉLECTRIQUE  Language of instruction: FRANCAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Engineering Sciences  Advanced level : Yes      Description   This elective includes courses, tutorials and a project.  The objective of this course is to present the potentials of systems using  renewable energy sources.  The first part is devoted to the main components for producing energy  from renewable sources.  A second part concerns the integration and management of energy within  the transport and the distribution systems. The conversion and storage   Project:    The title of the project:    Sizing of the electricity production facility using renewable energy sources  on an agricultural farm    The pupils are divided into several groups. The project is presented at the  start of the sequence. A defense is requested at the end of the sequence.  Two 3-hour slots are provided to answer students' questionslements used  in this framework will be discussed.
