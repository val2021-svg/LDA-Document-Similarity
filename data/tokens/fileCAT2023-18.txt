   2EL1120 - Interactive Robotic Systems       Instructors: Maria Makarova  Department: DÉPARTEMENT AUTOMATIQUE  Language of instruction: ANGLAIS  Campus: CAMPUS DE PARIS - SACLAY  Workload (HEE): 60  On-site hours (HPE): 35,00  Elective Category : Engineering Sciences  Advanced level : Yes      Description   Industrial and service robotics currently undergo deep changes with the  development of collaborative robots designed to interact physically with  humans, and to share the same workspace or the same task. Collaborative  robots are key elements both in factories of the future or in assistance  tasks. Human-robot interaction is therefore an active research and  development domain in robotics. It requires a multidisciplinary approach  to design safe and efficient advanced systems.    Subjects covered by this course will allow the students to understand the  main issues of interactive robotics and the technical aspects associated to  these complex systems in interaction with humans or their environment.  The course aims at exposing the context, the fundamental methodological  tools and the current research and development subjects related to  interactive robotic manipulators.         Quarter number  SG8     Prerequisites (in terms of CS courses)    •  Automatic Control (ST5)  •  Basic knowledge in rigid body mechanics to acquire by self-study if   needed         Syllabus    context   •  Introduction, brief historical perspective, industrial and research   •  Basics of modeling in robotics (geometric & kinematic models)   67         •  Dynamic modeling (rigid and elastic body) and control of robots  •  Force-feedback tele-operation  •  Collaborative robotics  •  Introduction to ROS (Robot Operating System)        Class components (lecture, labs, etc.)   Lectures, during which the presented concepts will be abundantly  illustrated by examples, will be complemented with tutorial sessions on  computers (in groups of two or three) to apply the theoretical concepts on  practical case studies. The tutorials will require preparatory personal work  outside class.     •  Tutorial #1 and Tutorial #2 : illustration of robot modeling using   Matlab/Simulink or python   •  Tutorial #3 and Tutorial #4: introduction to ROS (Robot Operating   Software) and application to robot manipulators     Class components:   •  Lectures : 21h  •  Tutorials on computers : 12h  •  Final evaluation (quizz) : 2h        Grading  - Tutorials #1 & #2 : Written report following the tutorials with functional  and commented programs [50% of overall grade];   - Final evaluation: written quizz with documents (2h) [50% of overall  grade].   - Attendance checked during tutorials, possible penalty on the written  report grade. An unjustified absence during a tutorial automatically leads  to grade 0 for the said tutorial.     Course support, bibliography   •  Handouts : Slides shown during the lectures   •  References : W.
